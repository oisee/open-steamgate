# AGENDA — open-steamgate

The living board: what is decided, what is open, what is next. Dated analyses go
in `docs/` as `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`.

## Decided (2026-09-11)

- **Repo created** as the OData/Gateway member of the SAP-protocol family
  (`vsp → odgp → steamgate`). Public, MIT.
- **v1 scope = classic code-based SEGW only.** CDS / SADL / RAP deferred (no
  local ABAP interpreter exists anywhere; Gap 5 in `docs/prior-art.md`).
- **v1 OData version = v2** (SEGW's native output). v4 rides with the deferred
  CDS/RAP path.
- **Clean-room reimplementation of the `/IWBEP/` interfaces.** No SAP source, no
  standard DDIC bundled. `open-abap-odata` is a *spec*, not a base (effectively
  unlicensed).
- **Reuse, do not rebuild:** transpiler + `@abaplint/database-sqlite` (Open SQL);
  fe-mockserver-core (OData v2/v4 wire); ui5-middleware-fe-mockserver (FE
  serving); abapGit TABU + `load-table-contents` (seed data); abap2UI5 playground
  (Phase-0 harness template).
- **Build only:** the `/IWBEP/` Gateway runtime (model registry + DPC dispatch)
  and the `$filter` → SELECT-OPTIONS / `io_tech_request_context` bridge (the
  crux). See gap-list in `docs/prior-art.md`.

- **Gateway lives here; the interface/DDIC layer lives in our fork
  `oisee/open-abap-odata`** (decided 2026-09-11; revised 2026-09-12: **we
  work in the fork and send the reusable pieces upstream as PRs**, one at a
  time: #40 registry + exception constructors (merged 2026-09-12), #42 EDM
  setters + facets (open); queued behind it on fork main: associations,
  function imports, `get_expanded_*` in the base class, SADL interfaces +
  annotations. Fork `main` = `upstream/main` + that queue, rebased after
  every merge. Steamgate first, backport what is proven). For the
  transpiler the same rule: fixes go as PRs from branches of `oisee/transpiler`
  off `upstream/main` (#1829 literal length, #1830 FAE dedupe, #1831 views +
  CREATE DATA TABLE OF, #1832 FAE empty driver; all merged and released as
  2.13.86 the same day, workarounds removed). Pulled in as a transpiler lib with
  `files` limited to `src/{oo,ddic,exceptions,internal}`. Upstream contact is
  issue #39 (license) only. The dispatcher, request context, serializer and
  `$filter` bridge are open-steamgate code. **Working assumption (Alice,
  2026-09-11): treat open-abap-odata as MIT until issue #39 says otherwise.**
  If the answer is "no", reimplement the ~50 signatures from SAP's public
  contract.

## DuckDB as the store, 2026-09-12 (night run)

`tools/duckdb-client.mjs` implements the transpiler's `DatabaseClient` over
`@duckdb/node-api` (in-process, columnar). `STG_DB=duckdb` makes
`test/setup.mjs` load the PostgreSQL DDL the transpiler already emits
(`NCHAR` → `VARCHAR`), the seed rows and the CDS views into DuckDB instead of
SQLite. **All 69 ABAP Unit tests and the HTTP suite pass unchanged on DuckDB**
(`npm run unit:duckdb`, `npm run integration:duckdb`, `npm run start:duckdb`),
including the SADL cube's `GROUP BY`. Adaptations: trailing blanks in
string literals are trimmed (ABAP CHAR semantics; SQLite tolerated the padded
literals, VARCHAR does not); the ABAP LUW is real (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE open
a transaction, `COMMIT WORK` / `ROLLBACK WORK` end it) and a failed statement,
which aborts a DuckDB transaction, is fenced by replaying the LUW's
successful statements into a fresh transaction (savepoint emulation; test
`ltcl_luw` runs on both stores); `STG_DB_PATH=file.duckdb` persists schema,
seed and data between runs. Open: DECIMAL/DATE column types instead of
NCHAR, and packaging as `@abaplint/database-duckdb`.

## Analytics on DuckDB, 2026-09-12 (evening): the cube that shows why

The thesis behind DuckDB was analytics; the demo had three travels and no
analytical app. Now: `ZSTG_FLIGHTFACT` (airline, month, status, seats,
price, currency) with 24 seed rows and `tools/gen-data.mjs` for any number
of synthetic facts (`STG_DATA_SCALE`), the CDS cube `ZC_STG_FLIGHTCUBE`
(`@Analytics.dataCategory: #CUBE`, seats and revenue `@Aggregation.default:
#SUM`) in `ZSTG_SADL_SRV`, and a Fiori Elements V2 Analytical List Page
(`webapp/analytics/`, tile "Flight analytics"): chart per airline, table by
airline/month/status with totals, compact filters. Every request of the
page is a `$select` on dimensions and measures the SADL runtime turns into
`GROUP BY`; on DuckDB that is one columnar scan.

Three things the runtime needed for that, all in `src/sadl` and
open-abap-odata #60: `sap:semantics="aggregate"` on the entity type (the
odata library learned annotations on entity types; without the attribute
the page does not bind analytically), synthetic keys on aggregated rows (the
UI5 model keeps entries by their uri; with an empty key every aggregated row
was the same entry and the table showed one airline 24 times), and
`$inlinecount` counted before the page is cut.

`npm run bench:cube -- <rows>` boots the runtime once per store with that
many facts and times the page's four requests (median of 5). 200,000 facts
on this machine, ms: total 21 vs 8, per airline 103 vs 12, per
airline/month/status 220 vs 33, filtered per month 26 vs 10 (SQLite vs
DuckDB). 1,000,000 facts: total 77 vs 10, per airline 575 vs 17, per
airline/month/status 1098 vs 39, filtered per month 114 vs 15; loading the
million takes 5.3 s into SQLite (multi-row INSERTs) and 6.6 s into DuckDB
(a CSV through `read_csv`, most of it writing the CSV in JavaScript). The
row store scans a million rows per chart; the column store reads two
columns. That is the DuckDB thesis, measured.

## SADL-lite, 2026-09-12 (night run)

Reference-data-source services run now, read-only, with analytics.
- **Build:** `tools/cds2ddic.mjs` parses `src/cds/*.ddls.asddls` with abaplint
  and writes into `gen/cds/` a DDIC VIEW (abapGit XML) per CDS projection,
  so the transpiler creates the SQLite view and ABAP sees typed fields; a
  `zif_stg_cds_source` class per view (static FROM, dynamic WHERE / ORDER BY /
  field list / GROUP BY); and `zcl_stg_cds_registry` with fields, EDM types,
  keys, labels, every annotation, associations with ON pairs and cardinality.
  Single-source projections only; joins, expressions and parameters are next.
- **Runtime (`src/sadl/`, clean-room):** `cl_sadl_gw_model_exposure`
  (`get_exposure_xml` → `expose( model )`) reads the `<sadl:definition>` a
  SEGW RDS MPC carries and builds entity types, sets (`<Structure>Set`),
  associations with referential constraints and navigation properties from
  the registry. `cl_sadl_gw_dpc_factory=>create_for_sadl` returns
  `zcl_stg_sadl_dpc` (`if_sadl_gw_dpc`): ranges → dynamic WHERE, `$orderby`,
  `$top/$skip`, keys, navigation through the association pairs, generic
  `$expand` via the dispatcher.
- **Annotation layer for analytics:** `@Analytics.dataCategory: #CUBE` →
  `sap:semantics="aggregate"` on the set; `@Aggregation.default: #SUM` →
  `sap:aggregation-role="measure"`, other fields `dimension`;
  `@Semantics.amount.currencyCode` / `quantity.unitOfMeasure` → `sap:unit`;
  `@EndUserText.label` → `sap:label`; `@UI.lineItem` / `@UI.selectionField`
  → `UI.LineItem` / `UI.SelectionFields` vocabulary annotations in
  `$metadata`. On an aggregate set `$select=Dim,Measure` runs
  `SELECT dim, SUM(measure) ... GROUP BY dim` (what an analytical list page
  sends on v2).
- Demo: `ZSTG_SADL_SRV` with `ZC_STG_TRAVEL`, `ZC_STG_BOOKING` (association),
  `ZC_STG_TRAVELCUBE` (cube). Generated-shape MPC/DPC in 7.02 syntax; real
  SEGW output is 7.40 and needs the abaplint downport first.
- Fork b18ea73: `if_sadl_gw_model_exposure(_data)`, `cx_sadl_exposure_error`,
  changeset types, `vocab_anno_model`, labels + custom `sap:` annotations +
  vocabulary XML in `$metadata`.
- Open: joins/expressions in CDS, SADL writes (`maxEditMode` ≠ RO), `$apply`
  (v4) and `$select`-less aggregation, DDLS downport of real corpus code.

## `$expand` round two, 2026-09-12 (night run)

Nested paths (`$expand=to_Travel/to_Bookings`) recurse per level. With
`$expand` present the dispatcher calls `get_expanded_entityset` /
`get_expanded_entity` with an `io_expand` tree; a DPC that fills deep rows
itself lists them in `et_expanded_tech_clauses` and the serializer inlines
those components, the rest is expanded generically. The framework base in
the fork (fc5ce3d) delegates to the plain reads, as SAP's does. Demo DPC has
the fast path for `TravelSet?$expand=to_Bookings` (two SELECTs). Two more
transpiler anomalies logged (FAE de-dup by DB key, FAE with empty driver).
Express route answers 500 on a kernel error instead of hanging.

## Deep insert and function imports done 2026-09-11 (night run)

Deep insert: nested navigation payloads in a POST reach `create_deep_entity`
with an `io_expand` tree; the entry provider fills the SEGW deep structure
(one component per navigation property) recursively; the 201 response inlines
what the DPC returned. Function imports: `model->create_action` with input
parameters, return entity type/set or primitive, HTTP method, `sap:action-for`;
`<FunctionImport>` in `$metadata`; `/Service/Action?Param='v'` dispatched to
`execute_action`, result serialized as entity, feed or `{"d":{"Name":v}}`.
Fork: `oisee/open-abap-odata` a5272e8. Lesson kept in code: SAP's
`get_form_fields` lowercases names, the handler uses `get_form_fields_cs`.

## Navigation and `$expand` done 2026-09-11

Fork: `create_association` / `create_association_set` /
`create_navigation_property` / referential constraints are real, `$metadata`
emits them. open-steamgate: `Set(key)/nav`, `Set(key)/nav/$count`,
`Set(key)/nav(key)`, to-many and to-one, `$expand=a,b` (first level) on
entity sets and single entities by the generic route a real Gateway takes when
the DPC has no `get_expanded_*`: `get_entityset` / `get_entity` of the target
set with `it_navigation_path` and the source keys in `it_key_tab`. Navigation
properties not expanded are `__deferred` links. Demo grew a `Booking` entity
(DATS field → `Edm.DateTime`) with a 1:N association. Still open: deep insert,
writes through navigation, `get_expanded_entityset` when a DPC implements it,
nested `$expand`.

## `$batch` done 2026-09-11

`zcl_stg_batch`: multipart/mixed in and out, retrieve parts dispatched one by
one, changesets in order and answered as a whole (first failure becomes the
changeset's single error part, later requests are not run; no rollback of the
earlier ones yet, the local SQLite has no transaction bracket). The Fiori
Elements app runs with `useBatch: true` now; Playwright covers list, filter and
**Delete from the list report** (DELETE inside a changeset, then the refresh
GET in the same batch). Keyboard-driven in the test: pointer clicks never pass
Playwright's stability check under the WSL headless compositor.

## Phase 1b — writes done 2026-09-11

POST / PUT / PATCH / MERGE / DELETE reach `create_entity`, `update_entity`,
`delete_entity` of the DPC with an `io_data_provider`
(`zcl_stg_entry_provider`: request body parsed by `zcl_stg_json=>parse_object`,
mapped through the model, EDM-typed conversion). 201 + Location, 204, business
exceptions as 400 with the DPC's message. CSRF fetch answered. The demo DPC
does real INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE on SQLite. Still open: a transaction bracket around changesets, complex types,
media resources/streams.

## Phase 4 demo — Fiori Elements list report, 2026-09-11

`webapp/` is a Fiori Elements V2 list report (SAPUI5 1.120 from the CDN,
annotations file, no controller code) served by the same Express process at
`/app/`, so no proxy and no CORS. The exact SmartTable requests
(`$select`, `$skip/$top`, `$inlinecount=allpages`, `$filter`, `$metadata`
with `sap-language`) are answered by the dispatcher. `npm run e2e` runs the
Playwright check (needs `playwright install-deps chromium` once, sudo):
**green 2026-09-11**, the list report renders the four travels and the filter
bar's `$filter=Status eq 'X'` reaches the DPC. Console shows FE V2's
`Only ODataModel with batch mode enabled are supported` for the transaction
controller: **`$batch` is a prerequisite for writes from Fiori**, add it to
Phase 1b.

## Phase 1+2 — read path incl. `$filter` done 2026-09-11

`/sap/opu/odata/sap/ZSTG_DEMO_SRV/TravelSet?$filter=Status eq 'A' and TravelId ge 'T0002'&$top=2&$inlinecount=allpages`
answers real OData v2 JSON from the transpiled DPC over SQLite, with the
filter delivered as `it_filter_select_options` and through
`io_tech_request_context->get_filter( )`. 35 ABAP Unit + 9 mocha. Writes
answer 501: next is Phase 1b (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE with body
deserialization, `/iwbep/if_mgw_entry_provider`), then `$expand` and
navigation, then Phase 3/4 (fe-mockserver front, Fiori Elements).

## Phase 0 — done 2026-09-11

`npm test` is green: abaplint, transpile, 6 ABAP Unit tests, 2 mocha wire
tests. A hand-written SEGW-shaped MPC/DPC (`src/demo/`) runs its Open SQL
against SQLite seeded from an abapGit TABU capture (`data/`), honours
`it_filter_select_options`, paging and `it_key_tab`. The ICF handler answers
501 until the dispatcher exists. First two entries in `ANORMALIES.md`.

## Sprint 0 — audit before building (highest priority)

Do this before any architectural commitment.

- [x] **Dependency-closure probe.** Measured 2026-09-11 on eight public SEGW
      repos, see `docs/2026-09-11-closure-probe.md`. The closure of a classic
      hand-written DPC is DDIC (data elements, domains, tables), not code:
      1–65 standard objects, 0–2 standard classes. It is capturable via
      abapGit per user, not something to shim. Framework-bound services
      (SADL, BOPF, CRM) are flagged mechanically. Tool:
      `npm run probe -- --closure <repo>`.
- [ ] **Corpus check.** Confirm the target services are classic code-based SEGW,
      not SADL-/RAP-generated (which have no transpilable `GET_ENTITYSET`).
      Mechanical now: `npm run probe -- --closure <repo>` and grep the output
      for `CL_SADL_GW_DPC_FACTORY` / `/BOBF/`. Still to run on the real
      target corpus.
- [ ] **Accessor grep.** Which `io_tech_request_context` methods do the target
      DPCs actually call (`get_filter` / `get_filter_select_options` / read
      `it_filter_select_options`)? Build for the shapes that exist.
- [x] **Clone + hand-audit `open-abap-odata` `src/`.** Done 2026-09-11, see
      `docs/2026-09-11-lars-ecosystem-audit.md` §4. LICENSE reads `todo`
      (verified). Data path is a literal; interfaces + DDIC are the asset.
- [ ] **Open-SQL coverage probe.** Run the target DPCs' real SELECTs (FOR ALL
      ENTRIES, joins, aggregates, client-dependent) through syntax.abaplint.org
      and the transpiler. Note the fixed-client-123 / no-implicit-MANDT
      correctness risk.

## Quick wins (from the 2026-09-11 ecosystem audit, §6)

Ranked in `docs/2026-09-11-lars-ecosystem-audit.md`. Recommended order:

- [x] **QW0** Asked upstream for an MIT grant on `open-abap-odata`:
      https://github.com/open-abap/open-abap-odata/issues/39 (2026-09-11).
      Not blocking on the answer.
- [x] **QW6** Scaffold Phase 0 in the open-abap house style. Done 2026-09-11.
- [x] **QW7** Closure probe: `tools/closure-probe.mjs` (static, abaplint
      registry with libs as dependencies). The dynamic complement is
      `"unknownTypes": "runtimeError"` in `abap_transpile.json`. Done 2026-09-11.
- [x] **QW1** Registry instead of the hardcoded test DPC, plus working
      gateway exception constructors: `oisee/open-abap-odata` main at
      4c2c301 (2026-09-11). Sent upstream as open-abap-odata PR #40
      (2026-09-12); open-steamgate consumes the fork without `exclude_filter`.
- [x] **QW5** Truthful `$metadata`: keys, entity sets, all EDM setters,
      facets, labels. Fork main (2026-09-11).
- [x] **QW2** Generic OData v2 JSON serializer driven by the model
      (`zcl_stg_json`, `zcl_stg_model_info`). 2026-09-11.
- [x] **QW3** `zcl_stg_url` + `zcl_stg_request_context` (all req facets, filter
      facet, `get_osql_where_clause`, `convert_select_option`) +
      `zcl_stg_dispatcher` (GET entity set / entity / `$count` / `$metadata` /
      service document, `$top/$skip/$orderby/$inlinecount`, OData error
      bodies, 501 for writes). 24 ABAP Unit + 8 mocha. 2026-09-11.
- [x] **QW4** `$filter` → SELECT-OPTIONS: `zcl_stg_filter` (tokenizer,
      recursive-descent parser, range converter). Per-property ORs joined by
      AND, ge/le → BT, ne / not-eq → E EQ, startswith/endswith/substringof →
      CP, datetime/guid/bool literals; inexpressible filters leave the table
      empty and pass the raw string. Unknown property → 400. 2026-09-11.

## Call with Lars, 2026-09-12 (what was agreed; the details stay off the record)

- **Upstream PRs are welcome, one fix at a time, small scope.** Anomalies go
  upstream as separate fixes, not into our workaround pile. NPM releases lag
  the merge; plan for it (#1829–#1832 merged the same day, release pending).
- **open-abap-odata license (#39):** no license is deliberate; Lars leans
  towards MIT but has not decided. Issue closed after the call. Our stance
  stays: interfaces as the spec, clean-room MIT implementation here.
- **open-abap-odata's original goal = ours:** a full OData runtime written in
  ABAP so old Gateway services run on Steampunk without SEGW ("replace the
  runtime, not the services").
- **Nothing that auto-connects to a real SAP system** goes into Lars's repos.
  A "local runtime → real system for missing FM/class, human in the loop"
  bridge is a side project on our side only.
- **Tooling stance (Lars):** catch mistakes with the linter, not with LLM
  rules; no skills/MCP; Node is enough; DDIC/standard-class scaffolds in
  abapGit form belong in `dependencies`.
- **Look at:** open-abap-gui (browser-only front + transpiled back on GitHub
  Pages, visual before/after diffs in PRs; classic reports → classes).
- **Open:** collaboration model (PRs straight into open-abap-odata vs our
  fork as the source); abapGit REST API as the blessed deploy path; whether a
  local SADL / V4 / RAP simulator is needed at all. RFC and a DIAG front:
  "cool but not necessary".

### Links Lars shared after the call (public)

- [larshp/hithub](https://github.com/larshp/hithub) — GitHub clone in ABAP,
  MIT, active. `docs/preview-deployments.md` is the pattern to copy: the
  transpiled app + SQLite-compiled-to-JS bundled by webpack into a **service
  worker**, served from GitHub Pages per PR, screenshots + visual diffs
  against `main`, pinned clock so diffs are deterministic. Same ICF shim we
  use. Has its own `ANORMALIES.md` and an abapGit-metadata script.
- [larshp/zqjs](https://github.com/larshp/zqjs) — a JavaScript engine in ABAP
  derived from QuickJS. The answer to "Steampunk has no JS engine".
- [larshp/stock-allocation-fun](https://github.com/larshp/stock-allocation-fun/pulls)
  — one task, one PR per model (Opus 5, Sol, Astra, Ox Alpha, DeepSeek…): a
  model bake-off on ABAP with preview deployments as the judge.
- [Flow one-pagers](https://docs.heliconialabs.com/flow-onepagers.pdf)
  (Heliconia Labs, July 2026) — abapGit Flow process deck; one-pager 11
  "Transport Sequencing and Preview Deployments" is where a local Gateway +
  Fiori preview per PR would slot in.
- [OpenCode Go](https://opencode.ai/go) — flat-fee key for open-weight
  models with OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible endpoints; the tooling direction
  Lars mentioned (nothing vendor-specific).
- [Gallo, DEFCON 20 (2012): Uncovering SAP vulnerabilities, reversing the
  Diag protocol](https://defcon.org/images/defcon-20/dc-20-presentations/Gallo/DEFCON-20-Gallo-Uncovering-SAP-Vulnerabilities.pdf)
  — the public prior art for DIAG (Core Security, later pysap). Citable in
  `docs/layers-we-own.md`.

**Done 2026-09-12: object page.** `sap.suite.ui.generic.template.ObjectPage`
in the manifest, `UI.Facets` + `UI.FieldGroup#General` + bookings through
`to_Bookings/@UI.LineItem`; non-draft Edit/Save. The gateway now does what
the Gateway does on PATCH/MERGE: `get_entity` first, the request laid over
it (`zcl_stg_entry_provider->set_base`), so Fiori's MERGE of one field no
longer blanks the rest. Fork: `bind_structure` derives
`sap:display-format="Date"` for DATS fields (dates render as dates).

**Lars, 2026-09-12 (afternoon):** invited `oisee` as collaborator on
`abaplint/transpiler` and `open-abap/open-abap-odata`, saw the preview
("looks promising") and said yes to backporting the steamgate work into
open-abap-odata; later the same day: self-merging there is fine, he has no
time for it. **Queue drained 2026-09-12 evening:** #43 associations, #44
function imports, #45 expanded reads, #46 SADL interfaces + annotations,
#47 display-format Date, #48 searchable, all merged (CI green, squash).
Fork `main` == upstream; `abap_transpile.json` now takes upstream directly.

**Done 2026-09-12: value helps.** `StatusVHSet` in the demo MPC/DPC,
`Common.ValueList` on Status and TravelId, `Common.Text` + `TextArrangement`
(StatusText filled by the DPC), `search` → `iv_search_string`; e2e opens the
F4 dialog, searches, picks, filters. Next in this line: object page
(`$expand` to bookings, edit), then `$search` on the list, console cleanup.

**Done 2026-09-12: the preview build.** `npm run web:preview` puts the gateway
into a service worker (sql.js), `preview.yml` deploys `main/` and `pr-<n>/`
to GitHub Pages with screenshots; `docs/preview-deployments.md`. Visual diffs
against `main` (hithub's `generate-screenshot-diffs.mjs`) are the next step.

## Backlog: SEGW offline (decided 2026-09-12, "отличный план")

SEGW is two things: an editor for the project tree and a generator. We do
the generator, the editor is the file.

1. **IWMO/IWSV → registry. Done 2026-09-12 evening.** `tools/segw-registry.mjs`
   reads `<service>.iwsv.xml` (group → model, service → DPC class) and
   `<model>.iwmo.xml` (model → MPC class), joins them by model + version and
   generates `gen/segw/zcl_stg_segw_registry`; the demo now carries its own
   IWSV/IWMO and registers itself, the servers call the generated class. Over
   the corpus it finds 11 services in 8 repos, incl. a SADL one whose DPC is
   `CL_SADL_GTK_EXPOSURE_DPC` and a project whose classes end in `_CUST`, not
   `_EXT`: class names must come from the objects, never from a convention.
2. **IWPR → `_MPC`/`_DPC` generator. First cut 2026-09-12 evening:**
   `tools/segw-gen.mjs` reads the tree (`SBD_*` design: project, model,
   service, generated artifacts, operations per set; `SBO_*` model: entity
   types, properties, sets, associations, association sets, navigation
   properties, referential constraints, complex types, function imports and
   parameters) and writes `_MPC`/`_DPC` `.clas.abap` + `.clas.xml` and the
   two empty `_EXT`. `--check <folder>` diffs against the classes SEGW made
   from the same IWPR. Corpus score: `abap_simple_odata_service` all four
   files byte-identical (timestamps masked); DPC `.abap` identical on 5 of
   7 projects, the other 2 identical modulo method declaration order
   (abapGit version); MPC differs by known things only: text-element labels
   (the tree does not say which labels came from DDIC and which were typed:
   an option later), `super->define( )` of older releases (`--super-define`),
   `set_conversion_exit`, and two repos whose classes were generated from an
   older tree than the one committed. Not yet: RDS templates (`define_rds_n`,
   SADL DPC delegation), media, text pools. `_EXT` never overwritten.
   **Second cut 2026-09-12 night, against SAP's own sample projects from
   A4H** (`docs/segw-mapping.md`): operations mapped to RFC/BOR modules
   (DS_TYPE 2, signature from the abapGit function group, `--lib`) and to
   search helps (DS_TYPE 6) are generated as SEGW writes them; SADL over
   CDS and EPM objects joins DDIC; complex types over DDIC structures,
   `set_action_for`, complex return types, `set_semantic`, `set_as_etag`,
   the real nullable flag, decimal digits/scale, entity-set flags read the
   way the tree means them. `/IWBEP/GWSAMPLE_BASIC` DPC now comes out
   line-identical; the RFC DPCs differ by release drift only (2012 key
   loops vs 2013 converted keys). Redefine and annotation-model projects
   are recognised and skipped. Corpus (third-party) still identical.
   The project tree mixes sources: `SBD_DS.DS_TYPE` (5 = DDIC structure;
   the corpus has 14) and the `GENERATED_METHODS_RDS` attachment for
   reference data sources (CDS via SADL; 2 corpus projects, they call
   `cl_sadl_gw_model_exposure` in `_MPC_EXT` and `create_for_sadl` in
   `_DPC_EXT`). The generator must route RDS entities to our SADL runtime
   and leave DDIC ones to the hand-written DPC. RFC/BOR mapping: done
   (second cut, above; runtime side = the RFC replay client). ODC (external
   services) exists in SEGW but not in any oracle we have: out of scope.
3. **Edit the model without a system. First cut 2026-09-12 night:**
   `tools/stg-compile.mjs` (`docs/stg-compile.md`): `<service>.stg.yaml` →
   IWPR (deterministic node ids) + IWSV/IWMO + the four classes through
   segw-gen; sources none / `struct:` / `table:` / `cds:` (SADL); the demo
   model as `src/demo/zstg_demo.stg.yaml`, round trip through segw-gen
   `--check` identical, IWSV/IWMO byte-identical to the demo's, compiled
   classes lint clean. Same night: `stg-compile --all` in transpile
   (`gen/stg/`, `src/` wins by object name) and `service:`+`set:` = local
   ODC through `zcl_stg_odata_client` (`src/demo_odc/`, `ltcl_odc`), and
   per-operation `function:`/`searchhelp:` mappings (the YAML twin of the
   mapped fixture gives segw-gen's methods method for method). Then
   `annotations:` in the YAML → `ZCL_<project>_MPC_ANN` over
   `vocab_anno_model` (open-abap-odata #61 object model, #62 `sap:label`
   from the property annotation), the demo's `webapp/annotations/` deleted.
   Complex types followed (`complexTypes:`, a property `type: <complex
   type>`, `returns: {complexType:}`; segw-gen had the templates from the
   ESH sample). Include and function imports over a module wait for an
   oracle: no corpus project has either (`docs/stg-compile.md`, Not yet);
   two small SEGW projects on A4H (an included model, a function import
   mapped to an RFC) would give it, on Alice's say-so.
4. **SEGW as an application. Foundation 2026-09-12 night:** generic CRUD
   over `table:` sources (`zcl_stg_tab_<table>` classes from cds2ddic,
   create / update / delete / get_entity in `zcl_stg_sadl_dpc`), the first
   two project-tree tables `ZSTG_SBD_PR` / `ZSTG_SBD_PRT` under
   `src/segw/ddic/` and `ZSTG_SEGW_SRV` from `src/segw/zstg_segw.stg.yaml`
   (`ltcl_crud`: POST 201, GET, PUT 204, `$filter`, DELETE 204, 404 after).
   Same night, the tables (`docs/segw-tree.md`): all 53 `SBD_*` / `SBO_*`
   tables of 21 real SEGW projects, generated from a derived spec
   (`tools/segw-tables.mjs`, fields in SEGW's order, keys as unique
   prefixes, `STG_SEQ` for row order), `ZSTG_SEGW_SRV` with one entity per
   table, `tools/segw-tree.mjs` import / export: every SEGW-written IWPR
   file round trips byte for byte (BOM aside); the hand-written fixtures
   and stg-compile's output do not, because they write fields and orders
   SEGW does not (list in the doc, for the stg-compile owner). Cloud pass
   `npm run segw:cloud`: 155 issues, 133 of them the 7.02 SELECT form the
   downport rule asks for. Then: stg-compile writes SEGW's field set and
   order (6c78bf9), push / pull and `ImportSet` through the service
   (ef500bc, 19f9a0e), and the editor app `webapp/segw/`
   (`docs/segw-editor.md`): the tree of a project over `ZSTG_SEGW_SRV`,
   nodes edited in place (MERGE), Create for every model node kind
   (types, sets + operations, associations, navigation, function imports,
   parameters, properties), Delete via `NodeSet`, Import IWPR via
   `ImportSet` / `FunctionGroupSet`, Export through `ExportSet`, Generate through `GenerateSet` (files landed by a dev route of `test/start.mjs`)
   (`tools/segw-editor.mjs`, output in `gen/segw-editor/`), launchpad tile
   `SegwProject-manage`, `test/e2e/segw.spec.mjs`. Generate in ABAP landed
   in three stages (16d7988, 3c50c73, a913296: MPC, DPC + EXT pair, RFC
   and search-help bodies with `ZSTG_FM_PARAM`), every file byte-identical
   to segw-gen over the corpus. Where a project's files land on a system is
   answered too (Alice, 2026-09-13, "вариант 1"): `RepoSet` / `RepoFileSet`
   give the project as an abapGit repository (`.abapgit.xml`, the package,
   the tree, IWSV/IWMO, the classes), abapGit pulls it and creates and
   activates the classes; we write nothing into a live system. The other
   route (a class over the Class Builder and a transport) stays unbuilt.
   Next: SEGW's wizards (DDIC import, map to data source), that pull
   against A4H (needs Alice's go), the editor's download button.

Order: after `$search` / console / T0009 (this list), then 1, then 2.
Merging our own PRs in open-abap-odata: Lars said yes (no time), so the
queue is PR → CI → squash-merge by us. The transpiler stays his to merge. A
second session only for step 2 in its own worktree, if at all.

## Backlog: what we said we did not want, re-assessed 2026-09-12 (three research passes)

**RFC/BOR mapping.** Cheaper than feared. `CALL FUNCTION` to a function
module with source runs already (FUGR → `abap.FunctionModules`);
`DESTINATION` goes to `abap.context.RFCDestinations[dest].call(...)`, one JS
object, no transpiler change. Gotcha: `DESTINATION 'NONE'` is not treated
as local, register it. The corpus has no RFC-mapped project, but every
generated DPC carries the RFC skeleton (`COMMIT_WORK` →
`BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT`, `rfc_save_log`, `log_message`). To do: bodies
for `/iwbep/cl_sb_gen_dpc_rt_util`, `/iwbep/cl_cos_logger`,
`BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT/ROLLBACK` as FUGR over our LUW (1–2 days, given
to the transpiler session); BAPIs without source: stub FMs over SQLite,
or capture/replay JSON through vsp (`.local/` only, 1–2 days), or the
human-in-the-loop bridge (side project only). BOR/SWO1: dead, ignore.

## Demo parity (2026-09-12 night)

Done: Create on the object page's bookings table (`POST
TravelSet('T0001')/to_Bookings`: the dispatcher creates in the target set
and hands the DPC the parent keys, the navigation path and
`iv_source_name`; a to-one navigation is 405, other writes through a
navigation stay 501), the booking's own object page below the travel, a
second app (`webapp/booking/`, list report + object page over
`BookingSet`), `webapp/flp.html` = the `sap.ushell` sandbox with both apps,
`UI.DataFieldForIntentBasedNavigation` ("Open in Bookings", hidden without
a launchpad) and `UI.DataFieldWithIntentBasedNavigation` back. Both keys
travel with the intent, so the target app lands on the object page. Not
done, by choice: draft, inline create in the table (draft-only in FE V2).

Order after this: ~~`stg-compile`~~, ~~ODC-local~~, ~~`function:` in the YAML~~ (done, step 3 above), then annotations in the file, draft last; the
search-help provider is with the transpiler session; the live RFC client
(open-rfc npm, record mode, replay substitutions) waits for a go.

## Media entities, 2026-09-13

The demo serves a picture per travel: `PhotoSet` is a media entity
(`set_is_media`, `m:HasStream`), its bytes come from `ZSTG_PHOTO` through
the DPC's `GET_STREAM` and go back through `UPDATE_STREAM`, the gateway
answers `<entity>/$value` with the bytes and their MIME type
(`ty_response-body_x`, `set_data` instead of `set_cdata`), and the JSON of
such an entity carries `media_src` / `edit_media`. `UI.IsImageURL` on a
property whose value is that URL is what Fiori Elements renders, so the
list report has a column of pictures and the object page a header image.
Library side: open-abap-odata #63 (`set_is_media` was `ASSERT 1 = 'todo'`).
`media: true` in a `stg.yaml` entity writes `IS_MEDIA` into the tree and
segw-gen emits the `set_is_media` line, which also removes one difference
against the two corpus MPCs that have media entities. The whole story is in
[`docs/media-entities.md`](docs/media-entities.md); not yet: `CREATE_STREAM`
with a slug, deleting a media resource, streaming instead of one `xstring`.

## The Fiori apps: real ones, and what deploying them to a system takes (2026-09-13)

Asked by Alice, answered from the tree: our apps are not a simulation of
Fiori, they are Fiori. `webapp/<app>/` holds what any SAPUI5 app holds
(`Component.js`, `manifest.json` descriptor version 1.59 with `sap.app` /
`sap.ui` / `sap.ui5`, `dataSources`, `models`, `crossNavigation` inbounds
and outbounds, `i18n/`, and for the freestyle SEGW editor `view/` +
`controller/`). UI5 itself comes from SAP's CDN (1.120.50): Fiori Elements
V2 templates, the smart controls, `sap.ushell`. What open-steamgate
replaces is only what sits below `/sap/opu/odata/sap/`.

So the apps can be deployed as BSP applications (`WAPA`, abapGit or
`/UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD`, deploy-back is the vsp sibling's job). Three
things differ between the repo and a deployed copy, none of them
structural:

- `sap.app.dataSources.mainService.uri`: ours is relative to the mount
  (`../sap/opu/odata/sap/…`), a deployed app wants `/sap/opu/odata/sap/…`.
- the bootstrap in `index.html`: ours is the CDN, a system's is
  `/sap/public/bc/ui5_ui5/resources/sap-ui-core.js`; under a launchpad the
  page is not deployed at all, the shell loads the Component.
- `webapp/flp.html` + `launchpad.js` are the sandbox and stay here; on a
  system the tiles are catalog content and target mappings over the
  `crossNavigation.inbounds` the manifests already declare.

Plus `ui5 build` for `Component-preload.js` (we run with
`componentPreload="off"`, fine locally, slow on a system). The looks are
the same modulo the system's UI5 version and theme. What the sandbox does
not have: roles, catalogs and personalization (test adapters), logon,
a real CSRF handshake, translations beyond the default language.

**Backlog item:** try it once on A4H, on Alice's say-so: a BSP with the
Travels app, the three changes above, a tile over `Travel-manage`, next to
the transpiled `ZSTG_DEMO_SRV` deployed the same way. That is the end-to-end
proof that a service and its app built offline land on a system unchanged.

## RFC replay (2026-09-12, transpiler session)

`CALL FUNCTION ... DESTINATION x` is served without a system:
`tools/rfc-replay.mjs`, installed by `test/setup.mjs`. `'NONE'` and `''`
run `abap.FunctionModules` in this process (the odata library registers
`'NONE'` the same way from every DPC); any other destination replays a
capture from `STG_RFC_CAPTURE` (default `.local/capture/a4h/rfc`, never
committed): `<folder>/<FUNCNAME>/<n>.json` with `params` (the input by
name) and `result` (the exports by name), exactly what `rfc call <FM>
<json>` of open-rfc-go takes and prints, plus optional `exception`/`subrc`
for classic exceptions. Direction of each name comes from the caller's
signature at replay, so a capture needs no direction markers; the split form
`exporting`/`tables`/`changing` + `importing_out`/`tables_out`/
`changing_out` is accepted too. Selection: exact input match (trailing blanks
and name case ignored), then the scalar parameters only, then the first
capture; no capture at all is an error that names the function module and
the `rfc call` line to record it. `test/rfc-replay.mjs` runs on synthetic
captures in `test/fixtures/rfc/`; real captures are Alice's, made through
open-rfc-go against A4H, and stay under `.local/`. Reference service for it:
ZSTG_RFC (steamgate session, in A4H).

**ODC / Include / Redefine.** Not in the corpus at all. Simulate: (a) a
local "external" service = a second MPC/DPC in the registry called
in-process through `zcl_stg_dispatcher=>dispatch` with a small
`zcl_stg_odata_client` (2–3 days, the core); (b) an online service through
`cl_http_client` (real HTTP in Node via `@KERNEL`; the preview needs a
fetch branch and CORS is not ours), +2 days; (c) an express proxy route
(half a day, a bypass, not composition). Include = merge two model infos;
Redefine = inherit from the other service's `_EXT`.

**Our own composition layer ("CAP for SEGW").** `*.stg.yaml`: one service,
entities from `cds:`, `table:`, `function:`, `service:` (include/ODC),
`abap:` (hand-written DPC), annotations in one place. `tools/stg-compile`
emits IWPR + IWSV/IWMO/IWSG (real abapGit objects → deploy into SEGW),
`_MPC`/`_DPC` through `segw-gen`, and routes `cds:` to SADL, `table:` to a
generic Open-SQL DPC, `service:` to the client above. First step (1 day):
`cds:` + `abap:` only, the demo rewritten on it, `--check` against the
demo's IWPR byte-identical. That is backlog step 3 ("edit the file").

**BOPF / draft.** A Fiori Elements V2 draft app needs, on the wire: a
compound key `DB_KEY + IsActiveEntity`, `DraftAdministrativeData` and
`SiblingEntity` navigations, four function imports Edit/Activation/
Preparation/Validation with `sap:action-for` and `sap:applicable-path`,
`Common.DraftRoot`, and the request flow create → MERGE in changesets →
Activation / DELETE draft. All of it is generic: a draft table per entity
(generated from `@ObjectModel.writeDraftPersistence`), routing by
`IsActiveEntity` in `zcl_stg_sadl_dpc`, the four actions implemented once,
one shared draft-admin table. ~9 days to a working draft app (guid/boolean
keys 1, SADL writes 2, draft metadata 2, actions 2, e2e 1, downport of
7.40 MPC/DPC 1). What cannot be shimmed: real BOPF determinations/
validations/actions in customer code; abapGit does not serialize the BO
model, so `/bobf/` stubs (+5–8 days) only pay off with a second BOPF repo
in the corpus. Every corpus SADL exposure is `maxEditMode="RO"`: writes
have no real oracle. Locks and `DraftIsCreatedByMe` need a user, ours is
fixed.

Decision pending (Alice): which of these enters the plan and in what
order; the composition layer and RFC shims are the cheapest, draft the
most visible for Fiori people.

**Live and record (2026-09-12, later the same day).** `tools/rfc-live.mjs`:
a live client on the `open-rfc` npm package (SDK-free TypeScript, node
22.14+, zero dependencies; loads on node 26 too), one session per
destination opened on the first call and closed when the process ends,
same runtime signature in and the same JSON convention out as the replay
(`toJson`/`fromJson` shared), classic exceptions mapped to `sy-subrc`
through the caller's EXCEPTIONS, anything else thrown. `record` is live
plus a capture file per call in the replay format, so a captured dataset
comes out of an end-to-end run. `.local/rfc-destinations.json` (never
committed; `docs/rfc-destinations.example.json`) maps destination names to
kinds `local | replay | live | record | fallback`; `connection` is an
object in the node-rfc convention or a path to an open-rfc-go `.rfc.json`
(`~/.rfc.json#A4H`). Replay results take placeholders (`{{param:IV_X}}`,
`{{now:YYYYMMDD}}`, `{{seq:NAME:8}}`, `{{sql:SELECT ...}}` against our
database) so a read after a create finds what was created. Live is node
only; the preview keeps local and replay. Tests fake the open-rfc client;
a run against A4H is by hand, on Alice's say-so, never in CI.

## DDIC routing rule (Lars, chat 2026-09-12 evening)

- **open-abap-core takes only released data elements** (C1 contract); he
  wants core small.
- Everything not released goes to **open-abap/open-abap-deprecated**
  ("deprecated artifacts", MIT, empty as of today): PRs there for what the
  on-prem corpus needs (`/IWFND/SU_ERRLOG`, CRM/BOPF/LXE structures).
- **abapedia/s4-private-2022-doma-and-dtel**: released + deprecated DOMA/DTEL
  of S/4 2022 in abapGit form (23,661 DTEL, 189 DOMA, 2.5 MB, **no license
  file**): cloned into `.local/lars/`, picked up by `segw:closure` as an
  optional library; not vendored, not a transpiler lib until the license is
  clear. With it the missing-DDIC bucket of the corpus went from 1143 to
  947 issues (abap_simple_odata_service to 0); what remains is mostly the
  repositories' own Z/Y structures (TABL) and CRM/BOPF pieces.
- The transpiler session re-sorts its core PRs #1213–#1215 by this rule.

## Backlog: Gateway extension points the corpus really uses (2026-09-12)

Counted over the corpus DPC/MPC classes. Have: `sap:` annotations and
vocabulary in `$metadata`, SADL exposure, `execute_action`,
`get_expanded_*`, every `io_tech_request_context` facet, changeset types.
Missing, in order of use:
- `get_logger` (17) and `get_message_container` (8) from
  `/iwbep/if_mgw_conv_srv_runtime`: check what open-abap-core stubs and
  make them real (messages must reach the OData error body).
- `set_header` (5) / `get_request_header` (2) on the runtime: response and
  request headers from the DPC.
- media: `get_stream` / `create_stream` (4 each), `$value`, `set_is_media`.
- changesets: `changeset_begin` / `changeset_process` / `changeset_end`
  (4); today `$batch` calls the operations one by one.
- vocabulary annotation providers: `vocab_anno_model` (2) in `_MPC_EXT`,
  `/iwbep/if_mgw_vocan_model`, `IWVB` objects.

## Ideas parked (2026-09-11)

- **DuckDB: done as a spike 2026-09-12** (section above). ClickHouse would
  be the same adapter shape without UPDATE/DELETE semantics; not started.
- **SADL-lite: done 2026-09-12** (see the section above); joins and writes
  remain.
- **SAP GUI front (DIAG) for reports and dynpros.** Orthogonal to OData: the
  DIAG sibling already has the protocol reverse-engineered (SAP-LZH writer
  included). open-abap-gui models a classic report / dynpro / selection screen
  through host interfaces (`zif_gg_report_v1`, dynpro builders) and renders
  HTML; a DIAG renderer behind the same host interfaces would let a real SAP
  GUI log on to the local runtime. Separate project, shares the transpiled
  runtime and the DDIC capture with this one.
- **`capture` tool:** probe JSON → abapGit data config for exactly the
  DTEL/DOMA/TABL/TTYP + TABU rows a DPC needs → `.local/capture/<system>/`
  as a lib. See the closure doc.

## Cheap checks that could shrink the plan

- [ ] Does fe-mockserver *evaluate* `$filter` (parse → predicate), not just
      parse? If yes, stronger prior art for Gap 2 → less Phase-2 risk.
- [ ] Is fe-mockserver's data-access seam a public, supported extension point?
      If yes, Phase 3 is reuse, not fork.
- [ ] Can `ui5-middleware-fe-mockserver` point at an arbitrary external OData
      endpoint (not only file-based mock data)? Load-bearing for Phase 4.

## Un-swept sources to check

- [ ] `SAP/abap-file-formats` + `-tools` (official SRVD/SRVB/DDLS/BDEF/IWSG
      spec).
- [ ] Standalone OData parsers: `odata-v4-parser`/`-literal` (Jaystack),
      `@cap-js/cds` `cds.parse.expr`.
- [ ] Alternative wire layers: `odata-v4-server` (Jaystack),
      `@cap-js-community/odata-v2-adapter` (cov2ap, battle-tested v2).
- [x] open-abap org: base-class impl of `/IWBEP/CL_MGW_ABS_DATA`/`ABS_MODEL`;
      open-abap-odata branches/history for a fuller gateway. Swept 2026-09-11:
      no-op base only, single `main`, no fuller gateway; `open-abap-sadl/cds/rap`
      are interface stubs (audit §3).

## Build order (see docs/prior-art.md §4)

0. Substrate stand-up (reuse) → 1. Gateway model + dispatch → **2. request-
   context bridge (crux)** → 3. wire layer → 4. Fiori serving.
