# A thin VS Code extension over a running osd (Q2)

*2026-09-25.* `editors/vscode/` is a VS Code extension that holds no ABAP
and runs nothing itself. It is a client of one listener (`npm start`,
`build/osd up`), set by the setting `osd.url` (default
`http://localhost:3030`). abaplint stays the language server; the debugger
is Q1 (`docs/debugging-abap.md`). What this adds is what needs a running
system:

| In VS Code | Asks the server | Where it is answered |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Test Explorer, "ABAP Unit (osd)": one item per `*.clas.testclasses.abap`, its test classes and methods resolved when expanded | `GET /sap/bc/adt/core/http/unit/object?type=CLAS&name=<X>` | `tools/adt-facade.mjs`, `UnitRun.classes()` |
| Run an object, a test class or one method; a failure carries Expected/Actual (the diff view) and the first ABAP frame of its stack as the place | `POST …/unit/object/run?type=&name=&testClass=&method=` (CSRF token and session cookie fetched with `HEAD /sap/bc/adt/core/discovery`, refetched once on a 403) | `UnitRun.runDetached()`, a child with its own database |
| Status bar: the generation served, hot swaps, the number of short dumps (red when it grows); "osd down" when nothing answers | `GET /osd/serving`, `GET /osd/dumps` every 5 s | `tools/osd-serve.mjs` |
| `osd: Show short dumps` (also a click on the status bar) | `GET /osd/dumps` | `tools/osd-serve.mjs` |

The two `/osd/*` doors are implemented by the child that runs the ABAP, and
under `npm start` the parent used to forward only `/sap/bc/*` and
`/sap/opu/odata/sap/*`, so they answered 404 on the port a client knows.
`test/start.mjs` now forwards every HOST node `src/icf/nodes.json` declares
for `tools/osd-serve.mjs` (#95).

## Key bindings

*2026-09-25.* `osd.keymap` (default `"abap"`) puts an ABAP developer's
fingers where SAP GUI / ADT (Eclipse) put them, over an `.abap` editor; set
it to `"vscode"` to get VS Code's own bindings back everywhere -- every row
below carries `when: config.osd.keymap == abap`, so the setting is the only
place this is decided. Scoped by `resourceExtname == .abap` rather than a
language id: abaplint is an extension this repo does not install or
control, so which language id it registers (if any) is not something a
`when` clause here can depend on. F8 alone widens that to a `resourceFilename
=~ /regex/` match (`resourceExtname` is only ever the last extension, and a
TABL's own file is `<table>.tabl.xml`, a DDLS's `<view>.ddls.asddls` or
`.ddls.xml`) -- Ctrl+F2/Ctrl+F3/F9 stay `.abap`-only, since Check/Activate/
Classrun do not reach either type (Q7, below).

| Key | SAP GUI / ADT | Here | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ctrl+F2 | Check | `osd.check` -- the current buffer (not necessarily saved) against `checkruns` (`tools/adt-facade.mjs` ~1683-1727), diagnostics on the lines | -- |
| Ctrl+F3 | Activate | `osd.activate` -- saves the file, then `activation` (~1835-1924); a failure's issues go to Problems, a pass shows the generation that now serves it (`X-OSD-Generation`) | -- |
| Ctrl+Shift+F3 | Activate all inactive | -- | **left out**: `GET .../activation/inactiveobjects` always answers an empty list by design (`tools/adt-facade.mjs`, "nothing here is ever inactive: an object is what the file says") -- there is no inactive set on the server for this to activate |
| F8 | Run | `osd.run` -- dispatched by object type (`lib.js` `RUN_TABLE` / `runActionFor`, SE80's own dispatch, table below); a class with ABAP Unit tests runs them (Test Explorer's `testing.runCurrentFile`) | see the table below |
| F9 | Run as ABAP Application (Console) | `osd.classrun` -- the current class against `oo/classrun` (Q6b, below), output in its own Output channel "osd console" | -- |
| Ctrl+Shift+F10 | Run ABAP Unit | the built-in `testing.runCurrentFile` | -- |
| F5 / F6 / F7 / F8, while a debug session is active | Step Into / Step Over / Return / Continue | the built-in `workbench.action.debug.step{Into,Over,Out}` / `.continue`, remapped only `when inDebugMode && resourceExtname == .abap`, so a non-ABAP debug session keeps VS Code's own F5 continue / F10 step over / F11 step into | -- |
| Ctrl+Shift+B | Toggle breakpoint | the built-in `editor.debug.action.toggleBreakpoint` | -- |
| F1 on a keyword | ABAP keyword documentation | -- | **left out**: ADT resolves a keyword to its help.sap.com page through its own shipped keyword-to-file index; a guessed URL (`abap` + the word + `.htm`) is wrong for enough keywords that a dead link is worse than no binding |

F8's dispatch by object type (`lib.js` `runActionFor`, held to this table by
`test/vscode-extension.mjs` without a server):

| Type | F8 here |
| --- | --- |
| CLAS, name ends `_DPC_EXT`, cursor inside a `<set>_get_entityset` / `<set>_get_entity` method | calls the set, the same as that method's CodeLens (Q2b, below) |
| CLAS, name ends `_DPC_EXT` / `_MPC_EXT`, otherwise | not yet: the rest of a Gateway client |
| CLAS, has an ABAP Unit test include | runs them (Test Explorer) |
| CLAS, declares `IF_OO_ADT_CLASSRUN`, no tests | classrun (Q6b, below) -- ABAP Unit still wins when a class carries both |
| CLAS, neither | not yet: put `IF_OO_ADT_CLASSRUN` on the class, or give it tests |
| INTF | nothing of its own to run |
| PROG | not yet: no server route to run a report headlessly |
| FUGR | not yet: a test form from `GET /sap/bc/osd/rfc/functions/<NAME>`, then `POST /call` |
| TABL, DDLS | data preview (Q7, below) |
| IWSV | not yet: the Gateway client on the service document |
| SICF | not yet: open the node's URL |

## Test Explorer groups

*2026-09-26.* Before this, "ABAP Unit (osd)" was one flat list: every
`*.clas.testclasses.abap` `findFiles()` turned up became a sibling, so a
project class sat next to `CL_ABAP_*` and `/UI2/CL_JSON` from
`open-abap-core` under `.local/lars/` -- and any workspace that opened a lib
clone as its own root, or a lib file the exclude glob missed, mixed the two
sets with nothing to tell them apart. Now the tree has four top-level
groups, decided per file by `lib.js`'s `classifyTestPath()`, the pure half
(`test/vscode-extension.mjs` holds it to real paths of this tree):

| Group | What is in it | Sub-node |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Project** | `src/`, `test/`, `gen/` -- `abap_transpile.json`'s own `input_folder`, minus any that is also a lib's own folder | none of its own (Project lists straight, or by package once it clears the threshold below) |
| **Packs** | `packs/<name>/**` | one per pack, always |
| **Workspace layers** | a running B0 launcher's own `layers` (`launcher.js` `detectWorkspaceLayers`) -- shown only while one is known | one per layer |
| **System** | `abap_transpile.json`'s own `libs` (`.local/lars/open-abap-core`, `abapgit`, `express-icf-shim`, `open-abap-apc`, `open-abap-gui`, `open-abap-odata`, `ajson`) | one per lib, always; collapsed by default the way any Test Explorer node with unexpanded children already is |

`classifyTestPath()` is checked in that order for a reason: a workspace
layer can sit anywhere on disk, even inside what would otherwise read as a
lib's own folder, so it wins first. `osd.tests.showSystem` (default `true`)
turns System off (and skips scanning those folders at all) for a session
that only wants its own tests.

Once a group's own bucket (Project as a whole; one pack; one lib; one
workspace layer) clears `PACKAGE_SPLIT_THRESHOLD` (15) classes, `lib.js`'s
`packageOf()` sub-groups it further by the directory under `src/`/`test/`/
`gen/` that carries the file (an abapGit `package.xml`, when
`packageDirsFrom()` is handed any, wins over that guess -- none of this
repo's own corpus has one today, so the fallback is what runs in practice:
`open-abap-core`'s 62 test classes split into `rtti`, `http`, `json`,
`oauth2`, ... rather than 62 flat siblings under System).

`objectOf`/`fileOf`/`discover()`/`run()` below the object level are
unchanged, and so are an object's, a class's and a method's own ids -- only
where in the tree an object sits moved, so a run's history still matches it
by id. The cheap filter that was always implicit (a class without test
methods has nothing to run, `discover()`'s own
`(c.methods ?? []).length > 0`) now also runs before an item is even built:
`hasTestMethods()` skips a `*.clas.testclasses.abap` with no `FOR TESTING`
anywhere in it, rather than adding an item only to find it empty once
expanded. Running a group, a pack, a lib or a workspace layer runs every
object under it, the way the Testing API does by default for any parent
handed to a run profile -- there is no special "run this group" code beyond
expanding it to the objects it holds.

*2026-09-26, same day, as seen with the packaged extension.* Six bugs, all
fixed together:

1/2/6. **Classify a file against its own workspace folder, never osdHome.**
   The packaged install runs the system from a materialized copy of the
   bundled seed under `context.globalStorageUri` (`resolveOsdHome()`), while
   the window's own workspace folder is the checkout a person actually
   opened and edits -- two different trees. `classifyTestPath(root, ...)`
   was always called with `root = activeController?.launcher?.osdHome ??
   osdHomeOf()`, so a project or a packs file `findFiles()` turned up (which
   walks the open workspace, never osdHome) was classified relative to the
   *wrong* tree: `path.relative` climbed out of osdHome and back down into
   the workspace folder, landing on `classifyTestPath`'s own fallback branch
   with a `relInGroup` starting `../../...`. `packageOf()` then read that
   leading `..` as the sub-node's own name -- one node called ".." holding
   every Project class -- and Packs, whose own prefix check can never match
   a path that starts `..`, held nothing at all. The fix reads each found
   file's own root with `vscode.workspace.getWorkspaceFolder(uri)` and reads
   *that* folder's own `abap_transpile.json` (cached per root for the
   build), rather than osdHome's; a lib's own folder and a running
   workspace layer's own folder are already found by an explicit
   `RelativePattern` rooted correctly, so they needed no change. Readers
   (Q3), F8's dispatch (`RUN_TABLE`) and Data Preview (Q7) map a file to an
   object by its own filename alone (`objectOf`/`adtObjectOf`/
   `dataPreviewObjectOf`) and never call `path.relative` against osdHome at
   all, so this bug never reached them -- checked, not assumed.
2. **Packs empty** was the same bug (1), over a `packs/` file.
3. **Only a file the build itself would read is listed.** A path outside
   every one of `classifyTestPath`'s four roots (`deploy/`, a staging folder
   for a system, never one of `input_folder`/`libs`/`packs`) now answers
   `undefined` instead of falling into Project; a path *inside* a root but
   hidden by that root's own `exclude_filter` (the top-level list for a
   Project or a Packs file, the same list `tools/osd-transpile.mjs
   listFiles()` applies to `input_folder`, packs included, once they are
   layered in; the matching lib's own list for a System file, the same list
   `loadLibs()` applies) is excluded the same way -- `test/fixtures/`
   (`test/fixtures/adt-editor/zcl_editor.*`) and a lib's own excluded corner
   (open-abap-core's `/src/tcp/`) both go through this, not the root check.
   `transpileLayers()` now also carries `excludeFilter` (top-level) and each
   lib's own, as `RegExp`s built the same case-insensitive, unanchored way
   the build reads them.
4. **A demo that fails on purpose no longer reddens "Run" on Project.**
   ZOSD_TEST's `deliberate_failure` exists to prove a failure reaches a live
   client, so it must still run and still fail when asked for -- only
   `npm test`'s own build-time run needs to skip it, which
   `abap_transpile.json`'s `options.skip` (`{object, class, method}`) already
   does. `lib.js`'s `demoFailureObjects(config)` reads that same list (no
   second marker to keep in step with it) and, for a Project-group class
   whose name is in it, the Test Explorer puts it under its own
   **Demos (fail on purpose)** sub-node instead of listing it flat.
5. **A PROG's own local test class is found the same way a class's is.**
   abapGit keeps a program's `FOR TESTING` classes inline in its
   `*.prog.abap` (no `.testclasses.abap` split the way a class has), so the
   scan glob widened from `**/*.clas.testclasses.abap` to
   `**/{*.clas.testclasses.abap,*.prog.abap}` (`TEST_FILE_GLOB`, also the
   file watcher's own pattern now); `objectOf`/`hasTestMethods`/
   `classifyTestPath` already worked by suffix and needed no change, and
   neither did `discover()`/`run()`, which already pass the object's own
   `type` (`CLAS` or `PROG`) through to
   `GET/POST .../unit/object[/run]?type=...` -- that route already accepts
   both. `src/zosd_test/src/zosd_test_demo_prog.prog.abap` carries a small
   passing local test class (`ltcl_zosd_test_demo_prog`, over the program's
   own `lcl_counter`) as the worked example. **A function group's `FOR
   TESTING` is a gap, not silently listed**: the same route refuses
   `type=FUGR` with 400 ("cannot carry ABAP Unit tests here",
   `tools/adt-facade.mjs`), so the Test Explorer does not scan for one.

## Q2b: calling an entity set

*2026-09-25.* A CodeLens "▶ Call \<Set\>" over every `METHOD
<set>_get_entityset.` / `METHOD <set>_get_entity.` line of a SEGW `_DPC_EXT`
class's source. The class → service → set mapping is a server route rather
than a build artefact (the smaller of the two ways the class carried this
work): `GET /sap/bc/adt/core/http/segw/entitysets?class=<NAME>`
(`tools/adt-facade.mjs`) answers `{class, service, mpc, sets: [{method,
kind, set}]}` for a class the registry knows as a service's DPC, 404
otherwise -- read fresh off the tree on every call, never guessed from a
file name: the service comes from `segwRegistrations()`
(`tools/segw-registry.mjs`, the project's own IWSV/IWMO), the set's real
name and case from the MPC's own entity-name constants
(`tools/segw-entityset-map.mjs`, the type SEGW gives every one of them,
`ty_e_med_entity_name`, not the constant's own name). A `_DPC_EXT` and its
model's `_MPC_EXT` are read together with their base classes (SEGW puts the
constants and the generated method bodies there, the hand-written overrides
in `_EXT`), the way inheritance actually resolves them.

Clicking a lens does `GET <osd.url>/sap/opu/odata/sap/<service>/<set>?$top=
20&$format=json` for `_get_entityset`, or prompts for a key (defaulted from
the first row's own `__metadata.uri`, `keyOf` in `lib.js`) and does
`<set>(<key>)?$format=json` for `_get_entity`, and shows the answer in a
webview: the URL, the HTTP status, the time and the row count above a table
(the columns are the properties, `__metadata` left out), a "raw JSON"
toggle beside it. F8 does the same when the cursor sits inside one of these
two kinds of method (`lib.js` `methodAtLine` finds which, `RUN_TABLE`'s
`CLAS` entry answers `{kind: "call-entityset", ...}` when it does); every
other `_DPC_EXT` / `_MPC_EXT` case is still the "not yet" of the F8 table
above.

`editors/vscode/lib.js` carries the pure half (`entitySetMethodLines`,
`entitySetLenses`, `methodAtLine`, `resultRows`, `stripMetadata`, `keyOf`,
`Osd#entitySets`, `Osd#odata`); `tools/segw-entityset-map.mjs` carries the
server's own mapping (`entityNameConstantsOf`, `entitySetMethodsOf`,
`entitySetsOf`, `entitySetMapFor`), both tested without VS Code or a server
in `test/vscode-extension.mjs`; the route itself in
`test/adt-devloop.mjs`, beside the other `core/http/*` routes.

## Q3: readers of a class or interface

*2026-09-25.* A CodeLens "read by N · tests M · services K" over a class's
own `CLASS <name> DEFINITION` line or an interface's own `INTERFACE <name>`
line. It is the reverse of Q2b's own class-to-service map: not what a
`_DPC_EXT` calls, but who calls *this* class or interface, off the
cross-reference tables every host already seeds at start
(`tools/osd-xref-seed.mjs`, from the parse) -- the same direction
`tools/osd-xref.mjs --who-calls` reads for a terminal. A
`WBCROSSGT`/`WBCROSSGTX` row is `{OTYPE: 'TY', NAME: the referenced object,
INCLUDE: the referencer}`, and `INCLUDE` already carries the referencing
object's own name, never a per-include suffix (`tools/osd-xref.mjs`
`CrossReference#build`, the `WBCROSSGT` branch), so no include-to-object
mapping is needed to read it back. `GET
/sap/bc/adt/core/http/xref/readers?type=CLAS|INTF&name=<NAME>`
(`tools/adt-facade.mjs`) answers `{name, readers: [{type, name, include,
isTest, services}], counts: {readers, tests, services}}` for a CLAS or INTF
this store knows, 404 otherwise; the class or interface itself and any
self-reference are left out. The rows are read the same way the client's own
data preview reads any table (`data.query`, `tools/osd-data.mjs`) -- this is
a where-used view over the same seeded tables, not a second index. A reader
is marked a test when it carries its own ABAP Unit tests
(`tools/osd-unit-run.mjs` `testClassesIn`) and a service when it is
registered as a service's own `_DPC_EXT` (`tools/segw-registry.mjs`
`segwRegistrations`, read fresh off the tree the way the entitysets route
does); a reader can be neither, either, or both.

Clicking the lens shows a quick pick of the readers (Test / Service tagged in
the description) and opens the file of the one chosen, by the glob its own
type and name give (`readerFilePattern` in `lib.js`: `**/<base>.<ext>.abap`,
the same namespace-to-`#` mapping `objectOf` reads back) -- a type this
extension has no file shape for (FUGR, TABL, DDLS, ...) opens nothing rather
than guessing. A save anywhere refreshes the lens, since a reference to the
class open in the editor can be added or removed in any other file.

`editors/vscode/lib.js` carries the pure half (`readersLensLine`,
`readersLensTitle`, `readersQuickPickItems`, `readerFilePattern`, `Osd#readers`),
tested without VS Code or a server in `test/vscode-extension.mjs`; the route
itself in `test/adt-devloop.mjs`, beside the other `core/http/*` routes.

## Q4: hotspots

*2026-09-25.* Short dumps are kept in a table the way a system keeps them
for ST22: `ZOSD_DUMP` (`src/dumps/zosd_dump.tabl.xml`, client-dependent,
key `MANDT` + `DUMP_ID`), one row per dump -- the runtime error, the
message, the ABAP position (object type, object name, include, line), the
request (method, path truncated to 120), the generation, and the frames as
a JSON string. Capped at the last `OSD_DUMP_CAP` rows (default 1000, an
env var read once) so a long-lived process does not grow it without bound.

**Writing is a kernel job, not the application's** -- the same rule as the
end of a dialog step (`tools/osd-dialog-step.mjs`, "a rule for what every
host must do lives in a module they all import"): an AS ABAP writes a dump
*after* the LUW has been rolled back, in its own statement and its own
commit, never inside the failed one. `tools/osd-dumps.mjs` (`persistDump`)
is that module; `tools/osd-serve.mjs`'s `dump()` calls it, not awaited, only
after the request's own `dialogStep()` has already rolled back (its catch
runs on a rejected `await`, by which point `exclusive()`'s `finally` has
released the work process) -- `persistDump` commits through a fresh
`dialogStep()` of its own. `test/start.mjs`'s inline front (`MODE ===
"inline"`, `runtime === undefined`) has **no dump hook at all**: its catch
logs to the console and answers 500, with no ring and no `/osd/dumps` --
that door is declared only for `tools/osd-serve.mjs`
(`src/icf/nodes.json`), so there was nothing to wire this into, and it is
left that way on purpose rather than given a second, parallel writer.

`/osd/dumps` keeps its current shape (the in-memory ring of the last 100,
tested by `test/osd-child.mjs` and depended on by the status bar below) --
smaller than teaching it to read the table, and the two are two views of
the same events rather than two sources of truth.

**Reading is the freestyle SQL door Q6a's notebook already uses** -- no new
route. `editors/vscode/lib.js` `HOTSPOTS_SQL` groups `ZOSD_DUMP` by
`(objname, include, line)`, with a correlated subquery for each line's own
last message; `Osd#hotspots()` runs it through `Osd#freestyle()` and
`hotspotsFromRows` turns the answer into `{byLine: [{objname, include,
line, count, lastAt, lastMessage}], byFile: {OBJNAME: count}}` --
normalising every column to lower case first, because `tableDataDocument`
(`tools/adt-facade.mjs`) always writes `dataPreview:name` upper-case
regardless of how the SQL cased it, and a reducer that trusted the SQL's
own case would only fail against the real door, never against a fixture
that happened to agree with it.

In the editor: a `vscode.TextEditorDecorationType` per intensity bucket
(`hotspotBucket`, 1 dump to 4 = ten or more), a translucent red
(`rgba(255, 0, 0, alpha)`, heavier per bucket) laid over whatever the
theme's own background is rather than a colour of its own, so it reads in
both; hovering a coloured line shows `hotspotHoverText` ("N dumps, last
\<ISO time\>: \<message\>"). A `FileDecorationProvider` puts a badge
(`hotspotBadge`, "1".."9", else "9+" -- VS Code keeps at most two
characters of it) on an `.abap` file in the explorer, summed over every
include of the object. Command "osd: Refresh hotspots"
(`osd.refreshHotspots`) re-reads the table and redecorates; so does a timer
(`osd.hotspots.refreshSeconds`, default 30, 0 = off, re-read on a settings
change) and the end of `osd.run` / `osd.activate` (fire-and-forget, so
neither waits on it). The status bar's dump count (Q2, `$(bug) N`) is left
reading `/osd/dumps` as before -- the ring and the table are fed by the
same `dump()`, so the two numbers are already the same kind of count, just
with different caps (100 vs. `OSD_DUMP_CAP`).

`editors/vscode/lib.js` carries the pure half (`HOTSPOTS_SQL`,
`hotspotsFromRows`, `hotspotBucket`, `hotspotColor`, `hotspotBadge`,
`hotspotHoverText`, `Osd#hotspots`), tested without VS Code in
`test/vscode-extension.mjs`, including one round trip through
`tableDataDocument` so the upper-casing above is caught by a fixture built
the way the server actually answers, not typed by hand to agree with the
code under test. The write, the rollback and the read together, against a
real `tools/osd-serve.mjs` (`ServingRuntime`, in-memory database) rather
than a synthetic dump: `test/osd-dumps.mjs`.

**ANORMALIES-worth noting here rather than there** (a one-liner, since the
difference is deliberate and small): unlike SAP's `SNAP`, `ZOSD_DUMP` is
one flat table with no TemSe cluster and no per-user/task columns -- a
short dump here is what `tools/osd-where.mjs` can already say (the ABAP
position and the frames), and this table is exactly that, kept.

Not done: `test/start.mjs`'s inline front writes nothing (see above); OSGo
(the Go runtime) does not write the table at all -- named as a follow-up,
not attempted here.

## Q6a: a SQL notebook

*2026-09-25.* `*.osdnb` is a small JSON file of SQL (or markdown) cells
(`editors/vscode/examples/demo.osdnb`): a VS Code
[NotebookSerializer](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/notebook)
for the type `osd-sql-notebook` (`package.json` `contributes.notebooks`,
selector `*.osdnb`), and a `NotebookController` named "osd SQL" that runs a
cell the way ADT's own SQL Pane does: `POST
/sap/bc/adt/datapreview/freestyle?rowNumber=<osd.notebook.rowLimit>` with
the cell's own text as the body (`tools/adt-facade.mjs`, ~2358; `data.query`
underneath is SELECT-only and applies the row limit itself -- this is the
one façade route that already does exactly what a notebook cell needs, so
Q6a adds no new server route). The answer is XML, column-oriented (one
`<dataPreview:columns>` per selected column, its own metadata and a
`<dataPreview:data>` per row -- `tableDataDocument`, ~257); a cell's output
is that answer turned into an HTML table (`text/html`, escaped so a value
carrying `<` or `&` renders as text) with a status line "N rows · M ms ·
\<generation\>" (the generation off `X-OSD-Generation`, set on every façade
answer), plus the same rows as `application/json` so VS Code's own JSON /
table renderers work on them too. A refused statement (not a SELECT, or a
database never built) becomes the cell's error output, the server's own
message unwrapped. Command "osd: New SQL notebook" opens a fresh one-cell
notebook of the type.

`editors/vscode/lib.js` carries the pure half (`freestyleRows`,
`freestyleTableHtml`, `htmlEscape`, `notebookFromJson`, `notebookToJson`,
`Osd#freestyle`), tested without VS Code or a server in
`test/vscode-extension.mjs`; the route itself (already exercised in
`test/adt-facade.mjs`) also gets one round trip in `test/adt-devloop.mjs`,
beside the other façade routes that suite drives through a CSRF session.

## Q6b: classrun

*2026-09-26.* ADT's own F9, "Run as ABAP Application (Console)":
`POST /sap/bc/adt/oo/classrun/<name>` (`tools/adt-facade.mjs`), advertised
in discovery the way the real system does it -- a plain collection, no
`app:accept`, no compatibility-graph node
(`.local/adt-corpus/latest/bodies/00009-response.xml` /
`00008-response.xml`, the discovery and compatibility captures) --
instantiates a class that declares `INTERFACES if_oo_adt_classrun` and
calls its `MAIN` with a console object of this repo's own,
`ZCL_OSD_CLASSRUN_OUT` (`src/classrun/`), implementing
`IF_OO_ADT_CLASSRUN_OUT` the interface `main` takes. Both interfaces are
open-abap-core's own (`src/classrun/if_oo_adt_classrun*.intf.abap`), an MIT
library `abap_transpile.json` already pulls in whole -- they were not
missing, so nothing here is a clean-room addition of the interfaces
themselves, only of the OUT implementation and the route.

`WRITE` is kept modest: a simple value becomes one line (`name = value`
when a name is given), a structure becomes one `field: value, field: value`
line, and an internal table becomes a header line of column names followed
by one tab-separated line per row (its own line per row for an
elementary-typed table); anything RTTI resolves to neither elem, struct nor
table becomes a line saying WRITE does not format it, rather than dumping.
The answer is always `text/plain`; a dump is still a 200, the way ADT's own
console shows a partial run -- whatever the class had already written, then
`Runtime error: <message> at <ABAP position>`.

Unlike an ABAP Unit run (`tools/osd-unit.mjs`), which spawns a detached
child with its own throwaway database because a test's writes must never
land in the rows the application serves, a classrun **is** a run of the
application: it shares the one live connection every other request runs
against, wrapped the same way -- a dialog step
(`tools/osd-dialog-step.mjs`), commit when the work is done, roll back when
it dumps, the work-process lock in between. A dump is recorded exactly like
a runtime dump (`tools/osd-dumps.mjs` `ZOSD_DUMP`), not swallowed; the
console text already written survives the rollback because it lives in the
OUT object's own memory, not in a row. `tools/osd-classrun.mjs`'s
`ClassRun#run` (asked for through `store.classrun()`, the same lazy pattern
as `store.unit()`) does the work when the façade holds the connection
itself (inline mode, and every test here); when a served (child) runtime
holds it instead (`STG_SERVE=child`, `npm start`'s and `test/run.mjs`'s own
default), the façade forwards through a door of the same shape as the
existing SQL one -- `POST /osd/classrun` on `tools/osd-serve.mjs`
(`src/icf/nodes.json`, `Data#classrun` in `tools/osd-data.mjs`) -- because
that is the process actually holding the connection there. Verified live on
both: inline through the mocha suites below, served (child) mode by hand on
a throwaway port (5, in the PR).

**F9** (`osd.classrun`, its own Output channel "osd console") runs the
current class standalone, and **F8** dispatches to it
(`RUN_TABLE.CLAS`, `ctx.hasClassrun`) for a class that declares the
interface and carries no ABAP Unit tests -- tests still win when a class
happens to have both. `ctx.hasClassrun` is `implementsClassrun`
(`editors/vscode/lib.js`), the same regex `tools/osd-classrun.mjs` runs
server-side, over the editor's own buffer (not necessarily saved), the way
`ctx.hasUnitTests` is a file-system fact and Ctrl+F2's check already reads
the unsaved buffer.

Not done: ABAP cells in the SQL notebook (Q6a). The obvious design -- a
scratch class in a gitignored layer, written and activated per cell,
classrun immediately -- runs into two facts of this tree rather than one:
`ObjectStore#rootsOf` resolves the writable roots **once, at construction**
(`tools/osd-store.mjs`), so a pack folder (`tools/osd-packs.mjs`,
`OSD_PACKS`) has to exist on disk *before* the façade's process starts, not
something a notebook cell can arrange against an already-running `osd`; and
`ObjectStore#write` puts a brand-new object in the **first** writable root
regardless (`this.roots.find((r) => r.writable)`), not a root a caller
names, so even with the pack pre-existing, nothing hands a cell's scratch
class to it without a small store change (an optional target root on
`write()`). Under that, activating and classrunning the same class within
one still-running process hits the fact `tools/osd-classrun.mjs` documents
at length: Node pins a module graph for the life of a process, the same
reason the serving runtime recycles into a new one after every activation
rather than reload; measured directly on this worktree (occasional `lstat
ENOENT` on a file the build had just written, naming the *previous*
generation's hash even though `readlinkSync` in the same process already
showed the new one) and the reason this repo's own classrun fixtures
(`src/classrun/zcl_osd_classrun_demo.clas.abap`,
`zcl_osd_classrun_dumper.clas.abap`) are ordinary tracked objects built by
`npm run transpile`, not written by a test. The smallest fix that keeps
"sources stay files, git is the only version layer" is two small, separate
pieces of future work: an optional `root` on `ObjectStore#write` for a
caller that already knows which one, and a permanently-declared (not
pack-discovered) scratch root so a notebook does not need `OSD_PACKS` set
before `osd` starts -- neither attempted here.

## Q7: F8 on a table or a CDS view

*2026-09-26.* F8 on a `*.tabl.xml` (a TABL) or a `*.ddls.asddls` / `*.ddls.xml`
(a DDLS) opens a "Data Preview \<NAME\>" webview: rows (capped by
`osd.dataPreview.rowLimit`, default 100, "N rows" or "first N of M" once a
cheap `COUNT(*)` was worth asking for), column headers with the DDIC field's
own label when the façade offers one, a Refresh button and an "Open in SQL
notebook" button that seeds a fresh `*.osdnb` cell (Q6a) with the exact
statement the panel is showing.

Neither type reaches `adtObjectOf` (Check/Activate/Classrun do not apply to
either), so `run()` falls back to `lib.js` `dataPreviewObjectOf` -- a plain
regex over the file's own name, `run()`'s editor buffer and all, the same
"read what is open, not what adtObjectOf knows" split Q6b's classrun already
uses. The name it reads off a DDLS file is the CDS entity's own name (say
`ZC_STG_FLIGHTCUBE`), never its `@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName` (`ZVSTGFLIGHTCUBE`)
-- this client does not need to know that annotation exists. **No new server
route**: F8's rows and labels come from the façade's own `datapreview/ddic`
(a TABL) and `datapreview/cds` (a DDLS) -- the same door ADT's own Data
Preview uses (`tools/adt-facade.mjs`, `lib.js` `Osd#dataPreview`), which
already resolves a DDLS by its CDS name (`tools/adt-cds.mjs` `cdsEntityOf`,
against the twin view `tools/cds2ddic.mjs` writes under that name -- "the CDS
entity itself has no client... as on a system") and already carries each
column's own DDIC label (`tableDataDocument`'s `dataPreview:description`).
The row count, asked for only once the main fetch came back at the cap, goes
through the plain `datapreview/freestyle` door instead (`Osd#freestyle`) --
the one door this feature is told to prefer, and the one already built for
"run this SQL, hand back a number". A DDLS with no database object behind it
(an unsupported join, `tools/cds2ddic.mjs`'s own skip, or a name that does
not exist at all) answers the façade's own message ("DDLS X does not exist",
or the SQL engine's refusal), not a bare 404.

**Client**: `ZSTG_FLIGHTFACT` (and every TABL with a MANDT field, read off
its own DD03P rows in the buffer, `lib.js` `tablHasMandt`) is filtered to the
runtime's own client by default -- `WHERE MANDT = '123'`, `MANDT_CLIENT` in
`lib.js`, the constant CLAUDE.md's "Known traps" already names, not read off
the ADT façade's own identity: that one deliberately answers a different,
made-up client (`tools/osd-identity.mjs`, `identity().adt.client`, `"001"`,
backlog G.1b) so the façade's pretend system is never confused with the data
underneath it, and reading it here would filter for the wrong one. An "all
clients" toggle drops the filter and shows the MANDT column (hidden while
filtered -- every row would carry the same value). A DDLS never gets the
toggle: the CDS-name view has no MANDT column at all
(`tools/cds2ddic.mjs` `viewFieldsOf`), so there is nothing to filter or to
show.

Pure logic (`dataPreviewObjectOf`, `tablHasMandt`, `dataPreviewQuery`,
`dataPreviewCountQuery`, `dataPreviewStatusText`, `dataPreviewRows`), held to
`tableDataDocument`'s real shape the way Q6a's `freestyleRows` already is,
in `test/vscode-extension.mjs`.

## Trying it

No build step and no dependencies: plain CommonJS, VS Code's own Node.

```sh
npm start                                   # in one terminal
code --extensionDevelopmentPath="$PWD/editors/vscode" "$PWD"
```

or, to keep it installed, *Developer: Install Extension from Location…* on
`editors/vscode`. Never `npm install` in that folder: it has nothing to
install.

## Tests

- `test/vscode-extension.mjs`: `editors/vscode/lib.js` without VS Code --
  file name to object and include, include to file, a run's answer per
  method, the frame a failure points at, a check run's diagnostics and an
  activation's result read off the real documents (`tools/adt-documents.mjs`
  `checkReportDocument` / `activationSuccessDocument` /
  `activationFailureDocument`, imported directly rather than re-typed), F8's
  dispatch table, and Q2b's lens placement / cursor-to-method / OData row
  shapes, including one test run against the demo's own DPC_EXT and MPC
  sources through `tools/segw-entityset-map.mjs` end to end; Q6a's
  `freestyleRows` / `freestyleTableHtml` / `htmlEscape` /
  `notebookFromJson` / `notebookToJson`, including a cell value carrying
  `<` and `&`; Q6b's `implementsClassrun` against the tracked demo fixture
  and against a comment merely naming the interface, and `RUN_TABLE.CLAS`'s
  classrun branch (tests still win over it, a DPC_EXT still wins over both).
- `test/adt-devloop.mjs`: `core/http/segw/entitysets` against the real demo
  service, beside the other `core/http/*` routes; Q6a's `datapreview/
  freestyle` round trip (a SELECT over the demo data, through the same CSRF
  session the rest of that suite uses); Q6b's `oo/classrun` against the
  tracked demo class (a scalar and a table, formatted), a class that does
  not implement the interface (400), an unknown class (404), discovery, and
  the tracked dumper fixture's rollback-and-record path read back through
  `ZOSD_DUMP` -- all against fixtures already transpiled before this
  suite's `before()` boots, on purpose (see Q6b above).
- `test/osd-child.mjs`: the extension's own client (`Osd`) against a real
  `npm start`, through the parent -- the doors, discovery, one method run
  with the CSRF round trip.
- `test/osd-dumps.mjs`: Q4 -- `objectOf`/`rowOf` (`tools/osd-dumps.mjs`)
  against abapGit file names and `dumpOf()`'s own shape; a real request that
  dumps, against a real `tools/osd-serve.mjs` (`ServingRuntime`), writes one
  `ZOSD_DUMP` row with the right object and line while the rest of its
  changeset is still rolled back, readable through `/osd/sql` and through
  the same `GROUP BY` a hotspot query runs; the cap.

`extension.js` itself (the Testing API wiring) is checked by hand in VS Code
only; there is no `@vscode/test-electron` here, on purpose, since it would
download a VS Code per run.

## B0 spike

*2026-09-26.* Everything above is a client of a system started by hand. B0
(ADR 0003 point 5, `docs/ideas.md`'s B0 row) is the other half: the
extension builds and runs the system itself, so opening a folder and
clicking Start needs no terminal. `editors/vscode/launcher.js` is the
proof, plain Node with no `vscode` import (unit-testable on its own,
`test/vscode-launcher.mjs`), and `extension.js` is the thin VS Code glue
over it (`SystemController`, `OsdTreeProvider`, the ▶/■ status bar item).

**What it spawns is exactly `npm start`'s own two steps**, with
`process.execPath` rather than a `node` on some PATH (VS Code's extension
host already is one): `node tools/osd-build.mjs` (what `npm run transpile`
runs) to completion, then `node test/run.mjs`, waited on by polling `GET
/osd/serving` until it answers `ready: true` with a generation — robust to
the log's own wording, which grepping stdout for "serving generation"
would not be, though the same text is there too (`tools/osd-runtime.mjs`
forwards the child's lines to the parent's stdout, prefixed `[runtime]`,
which is what streams into the extension's Output channel).

**All mutable state lives in the extension's own storage**
(`context.globalStorageUri`, one subdirectory per `osdHome` keyed by a hash
of its path), never in `osdHome`'s tracked files and never in a workspace
folder:
- the database: `STG_DB=file`, `STG_DB_PATH=<storage>/db/osd.sqlite`;
- the TLS directory: a new override, `OSD_TLS_DIR` (`tools/osd-tls.mjs`
  `paths()`), pointed at `<storage>/tls`. It starts empty and the launcher
  never runs `osd:tls`, so there is no certificate to find — which is what
  makes plain HTTP the default. Without this a worktree that shares a
  `.local/tls` with its origin (`tools/osd-worktree.mjs`'s own symlink)
  would have opened one more HTTPS listener outside the 3531-3539 budget
  on every launch (measured: `44300 + port % 100` lands at 44331 for
  3531). `test/start.mjs`'s log line that used to read `TLS_DIR` directly
  now reads `dirOf()` so it still names the right directory when
  `OSD_TLS_DIR` is set.
- the generated pack manifests that add a workspace's ABAP as a top layer
  (below).

**The layer mechanism is the existing one, unchanged: `OSD_PACKS` naming a
container directory of packs** (`tools/osd-packs.mjs`, "a pack is a
directory"). Nothing new was built for this — a pack is found either at
`<root>/packs` or at whatever `OSD_PACKS` names, "a pack itself, or a
container of packs", and the container form is exactly what a launcher that
does not know in advance how many workspace folders there will be needs.
For every open workspace folder that looks like an abapGit repository (a
`.abapgit.xml` at its root, or `*.clas.abap` / `*.prog.abap` under `src/`
— `detectWorkspaceLayers`), the launcher writes one small pack into
`<storage>/packs/<name>/`: an `osd-pack.json` (`order: 900+`, so a
workspace layer always sorts after the tree's own packs and wins a name it
shares, "the later folder wins") and a `src` **symlink** at the folder's
own `src/` (or at the folder itself, when its ABAP sits directly at its
root) — no copy, and nothing is ever written under the workspace folder or
under `osdHome`. The container is rebuilt from scratch on every `start()`,
so a workspace folder that has since closed does not leave a stale layer
serving code nobody can see any more. This was the smallest of the three
options the task named: an env var for extra input folders does not exist
(`input_folder` is a build-config field, not read from the environment),
and the pack mechanism already does exactly what was needed, found by one
extra directory and a two-line manifest rather than by touching
`tools/osd-build.mjs` or `tools/osd-store.mjs` at all.

Shadowing is already said out loud by the build itself
(`osd-build: overridden: CLAS X: <hidden files> hidden by <winner>`,
`tools/osd-build.mjs`), and since the launcher streams the build's stdout
verbatim into the "osd system" Output channel, that line is already
visible there with no extra plumbing. A missing reference (the user's code
calling something the system lacks) is not yet surfaced as an editor
diagnostic in this spike — abaplint's own errors reach the build log the
same way overrides do, but nothing here turns them into
`vscode.Diagnostic`s the way Ctrl+F2's `check` command already does for a
single object; `npm run probe` / `tools/osd-inputs.mjs` exist for a closure
audit by hand and were not wired into the tree view.

**The UI**: an Activity Bar container "OSD" (`views` id `osdTree`) with a
tree of four roots — the state (`Stopped` / `Building…` / `Starting…` /
`Running on :port, generation …`), "▶ Open Fiori Launchpad", **Layers**
(the base `osdHome` plus every detected workspace folder), and
**Services**, grouped by kind ("Services tree", below). "osd: Open
launchpad" opens `http://localhost:<port>/app/flp.html` with
`vscode.env.openExternal` (the Launchpad node's own click; its
context menu offers "Open launchpad inside VS Code" instead, the same
webview pattern "Services tree" uses); a second, new status bar item
(▶ / ■, left of the existing generation display, which assumes something
is already serving) starts or stops the one `Launcher` this window
drives, and the editor-title button on `.abap` files is `osd.run` (F8's
own command) via `contributes.menus["editor/title"]` rather than new
code. Once started, `osd.url` is written to the launched address
(Workspace target when the window has a folder, Global otherwise) —
every existing feature reads that setting fresh on every call (`osd()` in
`extension.js`), so nothing else had to change for the rest of the
extension to follow a self-started instance automatically.

**Q6b's notebook gap does not fall out for free.** The storage layer this
spike adds *is* a permanent, pre-existing pack directory once a workspace
layer exists, which is the missing half `docs/vscode-extension.md`
(Q6b, above) named — but only the half that exists **before the process
starts**: `tools/osd-store.mjs`'s `ObjectStore#rootsOf` still resolves the
writable roots once, at construction, so a notebook cell run against an
*already-running* `osd` still cannot add a new root, and `write()` still
puts a new object in the first writable root regardless of which pack a
cell meant. Next step, not attempted here: an optional `root` on
`ObjectStore#write()`, and a permanently-declared scratch pack the
launcher always creates (even with zero detected workspace layers) so a
notebook has somewhere to write into without `OSD_PACKS` needing to be
set to something new after the process is already up.

## Databases

*2026-09-26.* B0 hard-coded `STG_DB=file`. The system already runs on
PostgreSQL, HANA and DuckDB (`test/setup.mjs`, `docs/db-backends.md`) --
this lets the extension pick which one, for the running system and,
separately, for a Test Explorer run.

**Two settings, not one.** `osd.database.system` (`sqlite` | `postgres` |
`hana` | `duckdb`, default `sqlite`) is what `osd.start` runs on.
`osd.database.tests` (`same` | `sqlite` | `postgres` | `hana` | `duckdb`,
default `same`) is what a *test run* uses, when it should be a different
one -- `system=sqlite`, `tests=hana` runs a live Fiori session on SQLite
while the Test Explorer proves the same `_DPC_EXT` against a real HANA, in
one window, with no second window and no second `osd.start`. Connection
settings are plain, non-secret `settings.json`, per kind:
`osd.database.postgres.{host,port,user,database}`,
`osd.database.hana.{host,port,user,schema}`, and
`osd.database.hana.fresh` (`STG_DB_FRESH`, below). Left empty, `host`/
`port`/`user` fall through to the client's own default (`tools/hana-client.mjs`,
`tools/postgres-client.mjs`) exactly as if the launcher were not involved
at all; `database`/`schema` default to a name derived from `osd.home`
(`OSD_<hash>` / `osd_<hash>`, `defaultDedicatedName` in `launcher.js`), so
two windows on two different checkouts never collide in one shared HANA or
PostgreSQL by writing into the same schema by accident.

**A password is never a setting.** "osd: Set database password (HANA)" and
"osd: Set database password (PostgreSQL)" (`vscode.window.showInputBox`
with `password: true`) store it in `context.secrets` -- VS Code's own
SecretStorage, not `settings.json`, not this repository. It is read back
once, right before a launch or a test run, and travels only in that one
process's environment (`HANA_PASSWORD` / `PGPASSWORD`), never in argv --
`ps` on this host never shows it -- and, for a test run, in the JSON body
of the façade request that starts it, never in the query string a server
might log. Clearing the input box (an empty string) deletes the stored
password rather than storing an empty one.

**The env, one function, two callers.** `databaseEnv(config)`
(`editors/vscode/launcher.js`) turns `{kind, host, port, user, database,
schema, password, fresh}` into the `STG_DB`/`HANA_*`/`PG*` env
`test/setup.mjs` reads, and only that -- unset fields leave the matching
var unset. `osd.start` passes its result straight into the spawned
`node test/run.mjs`'s environment, next to `STG_PORT` and the rest
(unchanged for `sqlite`, which still gets `STG_DB_PATH` under this
instance's own storage so a rebuild does not start from nothing; `duckdb`
now gets the same treatment, `<storage>/db/osd.duckdb`). A Test Explorer
run passes the same shape as `dbEnv` in `Osd#run`'s request body
(`editors/vscode/lib.js`), read by `core/http/unit/object/run`
(`unitRunDbEnv` in `tools/adt-facade.mjs`, an explicit allowlist of the env
keys a body may set -- this is the one route in the façade that takes a
body most callers never send, and it must not become a way to set an
arbitrary env var in a spawned child) and handed to
`tools/osd-unit.mjs`'s `runDetached` as `options.dbEnv`.

**The detached run itself needed one change to take a different
database.** `runDetached` always gave its child a throwaway SQLite file of
its own -- the whole point of running detached is that a test's writes
never land in the rows the live system answers from -- and did so
unconditionally, even when the live system itself was already on HANA or
PostgreSQL. `unitChildEnv` (`tools/osd-unit.mjs`) keeps that default
exactly when no `dbEnv` is given, and only when `dbEnv.STG_DB` names
`hana` or `postgres` skips the throwaway file: those two carry their own
isolation (a dedicated schema or database the caller already chose), so
nothing here should be layering a second, pointless one on top. `file` and
`duckdb`, explicit or defaulted, still get the file. Tests:
`test/osd-unit.mjs` (`unitChildEnv`, pure), `test/adt-facade.mjs`
(`unitRunDbEnv`'s allowlist), `test/vscode-extension.mjs` (`Osd#run`'s
body/headers), `test/vscode-launcher.mjs` (`databaseEnv`,
`describeDatabase`, `defaultDedicatedName`, `duckdbAvailable`).

**The stale-schema refusal surfaces, with its own fix.**
`test/setup.mjs`'s HANA and DuckDB (persistent) branches refuse a schema
this build did not stamp rather than silently reusing or dropping it, and
name the fix in the thrown message: "Use a fresh HANA_SCHEMA, or explicitly
recreate it with STG_DB_FRESH=1". That Error reaches the child's stderr
and then a process exit -- never a "serving" answer -- so before this a
person waiting on `osd.start` just saw "osd never answered ready" after
the *full* build timeout, with the actual reason sitting unread in the
Output channel. `Launcher.start()` now races `waitForServing` against the
child's own exit and rejects immediately with the child's stderr tail when
it exits first (`test/vscode-launcher.mjs`, "Launcher surfaces a child
that exits before serving", a fake `test/run.mjs` standing in for the real
one so the test needs no HANA). `SystemController.start()` recognizes
`STG_DB_FRESH` in that message and offers "Set osd.database.hana.fresh and
retry" on the error notification itself, rather than a person having to
know the setting's name.

**Found live, fixed on the way: a kept HANA schema died on its own check.**
Verifying this against a real HANA (HANA Express, reached over the LAN --
the reachability this task's own budget rules meant asking for it at all)
surfaced a bug in code this task did not otherwise touch: `test/setup.mjs`'s
HANA branch called `refuseUnmigratedHana(db, db.schema)` -- `db` itself,
not `{query: (sql) => db.query(sql)}` like the DuckDB branch two lines
above it does it. `refuseUnmigratedHana` destructures `query` off its first
argument and calls it unbound, and `HanaDatabaseClient#query`'s very first
line reads `this.trace`, so **every** connection to an already-built HANA
schema (the ordinary case: a second run, or a second connection within one
run, against a schema `STG_DB_FRESH` did not just drop) died with "Cannot
read properties of undefined (reading 'trace')" before running a single
test. Fixed by matching the DuckDB branch's own pattern; a regression test
(`test/db-migrate.mjs`, "a query method that reads `this`") reproduces the
trap with a plain object shaped the same way as `HanaDatabaseClient`, no
`hdb` or real HANA needed to catch it again.

**Packaging.** `hdb` (HANA) and `@abaplint/database-pg` (which pulls in
`pg`, PostgreSQL) ship in the `.vsix` -- both pure JavaScript, confirmed by
hand (`find node_modules/hdb node_modules/pg* -iname '*.node'` finds
nothing; `hdb`'s only non-JS asset is `lz4-wasm-nodejs`'s `.wasm`, portable
across platforms unlike a native `.node` addon). DuckDB's own native
module (`@duckdb/node-api`) does **not** ship, unchanged from before this
task (it was never on `RUNTIME_ROOTS`) -- `duckdbAvailable(osdHome)`
checks for it before a build is even attempted, so `osd.database.system =
duckdb` (or `tests = duckdb`) in a packaged install answers "DuckDB needs
the native module; not in this package" instead of a build failure nobody
asked for (`test/vscode-vsix.mjs`).

**Status.** The tree's state row and the ▶/■ status bar's tooltip read
`Launcher#databaseLabel` (`describeDatabase`, built from the config alone,
so it never carries a password and is available before any connection is
made) -- "Running on :3611 · SQLite", "· HANA (schema OSD_A1B2C3D4)". The
generation status bar item (the one that answers even for an `osd.url` this
window did not itself start) reads the SERVER's own
`databaseIdentity.engine` off `/osd/serving` instead
(`tools/osd-database-identity.mjs`, pre-existing, a bounded public
vocabulary that never serializes the connection).

## Services tree

*2026-09-26.* Before this, "Services" was one flat list of every APP/APC/
ICF/ODATA row `ZOSD_STATUS_SRV`'s own `ServiceSet` answered, nothing
wired to a click (docs/ideas.md T8). Now it groups by kind, each group
collapsed with a count — "OData (n)", "Apps (n)", "ICF (n)", "APC (n)",
and any other kind the server returns gets a generic group (title-cased)
rather than needing a code change first — rows inside a group sorted by
path, labelled by the server's own text with the path dimmed
(`TreeItem.description`). A row's own click opens it the way its kind
allows: the app's page or the ICF node's URL, or the OData service
document; APC never (a WebSocket URL does nothing opened as a page, only
"Copy ws:// URL" on its context menu). The shared setting `osd.openIn`
(`"browser"`, default, or `"vscode"`) decides *how* a click opens it —
`vscode.env.openExternal` or a webview tab that iframes the running
osd's own URL behind a `Content-Security-Policy` naming only that
origin, the same pattern `openDataPreview` (Q7) and the gui-reports
spike's `openWebguiTransaction` already use, reused here as
`openInWebview`/`iframePanelHtml`. Every row's context menu offers "Copy
URL" (APP/ICF/OData); OData also offers "Open $metadata"; APC offers
"Copy ws:// URL" instead of either.

`editors/vscode/lib.js` carries the pure half, tested without VS Code or
a server in `test/vscode-extension.mjs`: `serviceGroupLabel`,
`normalizeServiceSetRow`/`normalizeServiceRow` (the two row shapes below,
into one), `groupServices`, `serviceLabel`, `serviceContextValue`,
`serviceHttpUrl`/`serviceMetadataUrl`/`serviceWsUrl`, and
`serviceClassNodes` (the next paragraph). `extension.js`'s
`OsdTreeProvider` is the thin wrapping — `ServiceGroupItem`/
`ServiceRowItem`/`ServiceClassItem`/`EntitySetItem`, `openServiceRow`/
`copyServiceUrl`/`copyServiceWsUrl`/`openServiceMetadata`/
`openServiceClass`/`openEntitySetMethod`.

**Forward-compatible expansion.** osg-i7 is building a composing route,
one `GET` under `/sap/bc/adt/core/http/…`, that lists everything a system
serves as one tree — `{kind, name, path, text, pack, handler,
handlerUri, mpc, mpcUri, app, source}` per row, already kind-typed (an
APP row's own class-shaped field is `app`, a manifest id, never
`handler`) — replacing five separate reads of `ZOSD_STATUS_SRV` with one
shape an editor is built to read. It does not exist on `main` yet (open
PR, `feat/services-tree`, `GET core/http/services`) — `grep -n
"core/http" tools/adt-facade.mjs` on `main` shows every other `core/http/*`
route this extension already uses (`unit/object`, `segw/entitysets`,
`xref/readers`, ...) but not this one. So `lib.js`'s `Osd#services()`
tries it first and falls back to `ServiceSet` on a 404, silently: this
client is written to the row shape the route will answer, whether or not
the server it happens to be talking to has it yet, with nothing to set
either way. When it lands, three things follow with no further server
work: a service row's `handlerUri`/`mpcUri` (the ADT class uri) lets a
class node open by uri directly instead of a workspace glob on the name
(`readerFilePattern`, the same lookup Q3's "read by" quick pick already
falls back to); `source` names the declaring file (the `.iwsv.xml`, the
`.sicf.xml`/`.apc.xml`, or the app's manifest folder) for a context
action this extension does not offer yet ("Reveal source"); and a
DAEMON/JOB/TRAN kind, once the route starts naming one, appears as its
own group with no code change (`groupServices`'s own alphabetical
fallback) and, if it carries a `handler`, a class node under it
(`serviceClassNodes`'s own fallback for "everything but APP and OData").

An OData row expands to its DPC then its MPC (`serviceClassNodes`,
clicking either opens its source), plus, lazily, the entity sets Q2b's
own map already answers for (`GET core/http/segw/entitysets?class=
<DPC_EXT>`, fetched only once the row is actually expanded): each set's
own click opens the DPC at the `<set>_get_entityset` / `<set>_get_entity`
method's own line, reusing Q2b's `entitySetLenses` rather than a second
way of finding it. An ICF or an APC row expands to its one handler class
the same way. APP rows do not expand at all — an app has a manifest, not
an ADT class.

**Tests**: `test/vscode-launcher.mjs` (registered in `test/suites.json`) —
pure: `pickPort`/`isFree` over the 3531-3539 range and its exhaustion,
`detectWorkspaceLayers`/`looksLikeAbapGitFolder` (`.abapgit.xml`, `src/
*.clas.abap`, `src/*.prog.abap`, a `src/` with only XML is not a layer, a
folder that does not exist is skipped), `packNameOf`'s stability,
`ensureWorkspacePacks` read back through `tools/osd-packs.mjs`'s own
`packAt`/`packsOf` (a real symlink, nothing written into the workspace
folder, a stale layer removed on the next call), `waitForServing`/
`servingOnce` against a fake HTTP server (resolves once ready, times out
when nothing ever answers), `terminate()` against a real spawned child.
Then two real, unmocked runs of `Launcher` against this checkout on a free
port in 3531-3539 with a temp storage directory: a full start (build,
serve, one OData read of `ZSTG_DEMO_SRV/TravelSet`, `/osd/serving`, then
`stop()` and a check that the spawned pid is actually gone) and a build
that is made to fail (`osdHome` pointed at an empty temp directory), which
must leave the state back at `"stopped"` rather than half-started. Run
beside its neighbours as the task asked
(`STG_PORT=3538 npx mocha test/vscode-extension.mjs test/adt-devloop.mjs
test/osd-dumps.mjs test/vscode-launcher.mjs`): 130 passing, no port
collisions, because the launcher's own range (3531-3539) and its
neighbours' dynamically-assigned ports never overlap.

**Live smoke** (`.local/b0-demo-ws/`, gitignored, one abapGit-shaped class,
`ZCL_B0_HELLO IMPLEMENTS IF_OO_ADT_CLASSRUN`): the launcher, given that
folder as a workspace folder, built 1728 objects where the tree alone
builds 1727 — the one extra being the workspace layer's own class — and
`POST /sap/bc/adt/oo/classrun/ZCL_B0_HELLO` (after the same CSRF round
trip every other write in this extension already does) answered `hello
from the B0 workspace layer`. Cold start to `ready: true` measured at
~19.2 s on this machine (build ~12-13 s of it); a build the generation
cache already has (unchanged code, `test/vscode-launcher.mjs`'s own second
run of the same tree) came back at ~4.3 s. Stopping left neither the
spawned `node test/run.mjs` nor its `tools/osd-serve.mjs` grandchild
running, and opened no port outside 3531-3539 (confirmed with `ss -ltnp`
before and after) — `tools/osd-runtime.mjs`'s own SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGHUP
handler reaps the grandchild before the parent exits, so the launcher only
ever signals the one pid it spawned.

## Packaging

*2026-09-26.* One universal `.vsix` that carries the system inside it:
`npm run vsix` (`scripts/build-vsix.mjs`) writes
`build/vsix/osd-vscode-<version>.vsix`, built with the system `zip` CLI --
not `vsce` -- as a plain zip of `[Content_Types].xml`, `extension.vsixmanifest`
(both generated from `editors/vscode/package.json` the way `vsce` does,
`Identity`/`DisplayName`/`Engine`/`ExtensionKind` read straight off it) and
an `extension/` folder holding the extension's own files plus a runnable
system tree at `extension/osd/`.

**What is in `extension/osd/`**, found by tracing rather than guessing:
**not `output/`** -- see "two false starts, and a third" below for why a
first design shipped it and a second one dropped it again; `src/`, `gen/`,
`packs/` (whole -- generators read pack content, not a layer list),
`webapp/`, `tools/` (whole); `test/` minus `test/e2e/`
and `test/fixtures/` (`abap_transpile.json`'s and `abaplint.jsonc`'s own
exclude lists) -- not just `run.mjs`/`start.mjs`/`setup.mjs` and their own
JS imports (grepped, including one dynamic import, `test/setup.mjs` ->
`./seed.mjs`): `abaplint.jsonc`'s own `global.files` glob makes ALL of
`test/` an input to the abaplint registry `tools/osd-store.mjs` builds at
startup (`test/start.mjs`'s own `store.registry()` call, on the critical
path to serving anything), non-JS ABAP fixtures under `test/unit/`
included -- a fact a JS import graph can never surface, and the first of
two things a dry read would have missed (below); `data/` (root seed rows,
`tools/osd-packs.mjs`'s `dataDirsOf()`); `abap_transpile.json` and
`abaplint.jsonc` themselves; the library sources they both name, at the
exact relative paths (`.local/lars/<name>/...`), each trimmed to the
lib's own `files` glob (abapGit, open-abap-gui, open-abap-odata, ajson,
open-abap-apc) or, for a library with no `files` filter in either config
(open-abap-core, express-icf-shim), everything except that library's own
`node_modules/`, `output/` and `test/` -- its own build litter, never read
by our transpile; `node_modules/`, traced from `package-lock.json`'s own
dependency graph (lockfileVersion 3, flat `packages` map) starting at the
five packages the run-time path actually imports (`@abaplint/core`,
`@abaplint/runtime`, `@abaplint/transpiler`, `@abaplint/database-sqlite`,
`express`) and walking `dependencies`/`optionalDependencies` -- 86 packages,
46.1 MB, answered by npm's own resolution rather than a guess at "the
transitive deps". `open-rfc` (live RFC) and `@duckdb/*` (not on the default
path per this file) are left out on purpose, along with `.git`,
`.local/worktrees`, `.local/corpus*`, every other `.local/lars/*` clone,
Playwright, DuckDB, Postgres, docs, and every dev-only devDependency
(webpack, mocha, chai, terser, the browserify shims).

**Two false starts, and a third that settled it, kept here because the fix
each time is the design.** The first version shipped `build/by-input/<hash>/`
(the cache entry `output/` lives in) plus the `build/live` and root `output`
symlinks, on the theory that a first build on the user's machine would
recompute the SAME input hash and reuse it -- the ~19 s / ~4 s difference
this spike measured. Trying it found two independent reasons this cannot
work. `zip` without `-y` dereferences a symlink into a real directory when
it archives one (confirmed by `unzip -l`: `build/live` came back as a
directory, not a link), and `tools/osd-build.mjs`'s own live-switch has no
fallback for that shape at `build/live` (unlike `output/`, which explicitly
does) -- `renameSync` throws `EISDIR` and the build fails outright.
Separately, and enough on its own even with `-y`: the input hash is
computed over each lib folder's WHOLE tree, not the `files` glob a lib
entry restricts reading to (`tools/osd-build.mjs`'s `hashOf()`), so a lib
trimmed to that glob (needed to keep the size down at all) never reproduces
the hash of the untrimmed clone the shipped generation was built from --
the cache would miss on the first build regardless of the symlink problem.
The fix tried second was `copyOutput()`: ship `output/` alone, as plain
files, nothing else under `build/`. `switchTo()` already tolerates exactly
that shape on the first real build ("a real directory there is what every
tree had before this existed", moved aside to `build/legacy-<ts>`), so this
is not a special case taught to the build -- it is the case already there.

That crashed on a separate bug, fixed in the same commit (#106): the
packaged copy ran `tools/osd-build.mjs` to completion (1709 of the tree's
1727 objects -- the trimmed libs cost a few unused files, nothing the build
needs) and then `test/run.mjs` came up as far as "Listening on
.../sap/opu/odata/sap/" before an uncaught `ENOENT` on `abaplint.jsonc` at
the seed root -- read by `tools/osd-store.mjs`'s registry, never named in
the task's own file list because it is not a JS import of anything.
Copying it (and the whole `test/` tree it requires) fixed it; a bare "trace
the imports" pass would have missed both, which is why they are written
down rather than folded quietly into the file list.

With the crash fixed, `output/` still never reproduced a cache hit, for a
third reason found only by tracing what a real first build actually
compares (2026-09-26, `vsix-prebuilt-generation` task). `hashOf()` folds
`describeBuild(root)` (`tools/osd-transpiler.mjs`) into the generation
name. For the ordinary case -- the transpiler installed from npm, not
linked -- `describeBuild` already prints a portable string with no
absolute path: `transpiler: @abaplint/transpiler 2.13.89, published`.
Measured directly (`node -e ...describeBuild(process.cwd())`): true on
this tree today. The non-portable case is the one CLAUDE.md's "Known
traps" and "Working in the tree" call out as routine here -- a LOCAL
transpiler build linked from `.local/lars/` while a fix is not released
yet. There, `packageInUse()` reports `{kind: "linked", where: <absolute
path>, branch, commit, dirty}` and `describeOne()` prints all of it,
including the path, into the hashed string. `scripts/build-vsix.mjs`'s own
`copyReal()` **dereferences** that symlink when it packages `node_modules/`
(needed regardless, since a `.vsix` cannot carry a symlink pointing outside
itself), so the shipped `node_modules/@abaplint/transpiler` arrives as a
plain directory with no git metadata in it at all. A user's machine
materializing that copy calls `packageInUse()` on it and gets back
`{kind: "published", version: <whatever the built dist's package.json
says>}` -- a different shape, computed from different facts, than the one
the packaging machine had. No rewrite of the STRING closes that gap on its
own: making `describeOne`'s "linked" case portable (drop `where`, keep
`branch`/`commit`/`dirty` so a dirty local build still changes the hash on
the machine that built it -- genuinely a small change) does not make the
shipped tree capable of reporting the SAME branch/commit/dirty, because
that information no longer exists on disk after `copyReal` -- it lived in
`.git`, which a lib's own trim already excludes as build litter. Closing it
for real needs a metadata file written at packaging time (the packaging
machine's true `describeBuild()`) and read back by `packageInUse()` in
preference to what the tree looks like -- a second code path in a function
whose whole point today is "trust what's on disk", not the small, clean
change the hour this task set aside was for. So, per Alice's call
(2026-09-26): **fallback (b)**. `output/` is not shipped at all. A first
start is an ordinary full, cold build (measured below); a second start of
the SAME materialized copy is fast because by then it has grown its own
matching cache, the same way any other checkout's second build does --
unaffected by any of this, since by then `describeBuild(materializedRoot)`
is being compared against itself, not against a different machine's build.

**Next step, not done here**: make `describeOne()`'s "linked" case
portable in the sense above (branch/commit/dirty, no absolute path) --
worth doing on its own for CI log readability regardless of packaging --
and, separately, decide whether per-library generation reuse (shipping a
metadata file that lets a materialized copy claim the packaging machine's
`describeBuild()` when the packaged transpiler was a local build) is worth
the second code path it needs. Backlogged rather than attempted under this
task's one-hour budget for it.

**Materializing on first start** (`osd.home` unset, the packaged path):
`ensureMaterializedHome()` (`editors/vscode/launcher.js`) copies
`extension/osd/` into `<globalStorageUri>/osd-home-<version>/` once --
`linkOrCopyTree()` hard-links every regular file and keeps a symlink as a
symlink, so the copy costs close to nothing on one filesystem, falling
back to a real copy across a device boundary (`EXDEV`). A marker file
(`.osd-materialized`) makes a second call a no-op; a version change
removes every OTHER `osd-home-*` directory first, so an update does not
accumulate stale copies. `osd.home`, when set, still wins -- the
dev path, unchanged, and the only path a checkout with no bundled
`extension/osd/` (the symlinked dev install) ever takes. `build/` and
`gen/` are then written inside that storage copy by the ordinary build,
never inside `extension/osd/` itself. Pure-function tests: `test/vscode-launcher.mjs`
("packaging" describe block) -- the hard-link/symlink shapes, the
once-per-version rule, the old-version cleanup, all against a small fake
seed, never the real 100+ MB one.

**Measured before** (2026-09-26, `output/` shipped, the state #105/#106
left this in, version 0.1.1): `.vsix` 53.5 MB, unpacked 148.7 MB
(`output/` 59.6 MB of it, plain files minus `*.mjs.map`); first start
22.9 s (materialize 0.45 s, build+serve 22.4 s -- the "cache miss" the
paragraph above traces to `describeBuild()`, plus a spurious "moved to
build/legacy-&lt;ts&gt;" since a real directory was already sitting at
`output/`); second start of the same materialized copy 4.2 s.

**Measured after** (same machine, same method, `npm run vsix` then a
direct run of `editors/vscode/launcher.js` against the unzipped `.vsix`,
`osd.home` unset, version 0.1.2, fallback (b) -- `output/` dropped
entirely):

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `.vsix` | 34.7 MB (was 53.5 MB, -18.8 MB) |
| unpacked (`extension/osd/` + the extension's own files) | 90.8 MB (was 148.7 MB, -57.9 MB) |
| -- `node_modules/` (88 packages, traced from package-lock.json) | 47.3 MB |
| -- `packs/` (o4d, zork, zvdb, lsd -- whole, media included) | 22.1 MB |
| -- `src/` + `gen/` + `webapp/` + `tools/` + `test/` + `data/` | 13.7 MB |
| -- `.local/lars/` (7 libraries, `files`-glob-trimmed where named) | 7.5 MB |
| -- the extension's own files (`extension.js`, `lib.js`, `launcher.js`, `resources/`, `examples/`) | 0.1 MB |
| first start (materialize + full cold build + serve), same storageDir both times | 23.6 s (`osd-build: transpile` runs, no `moved to build/legacy`) |
| second start, same materialized copy AND same storageDir (cache hit) | 4.3 s (`osd-build: transpile` does not run) |

First start is, within measurement noise, the same ~19-23 s this spike
measured throughout (it was always a cold build in practice, the cache
never having actually hit); the difference this change makes is -57.9 MB
unpacked / -18.8 MB of `.vsix`, one fewer spurious log line, and an honest
design: nothing here claims a cache hit it cannot deliver. Second start
is unchanged, because it was never the problem -- a materialized copy
growing its own matching cache on its own first build is the ordinary
`build/by-input/<hash>/` mechanism, working exactly as it does in any
checkout. (The two runs above share one `storageDir`, matching
`storageDirFor()` in `editors/vscode/extension.js`, which is deterministic
in `osdHome` -- a real VS Code restart reuses it. An earlier measurement
pass using a fresh `storageDir` per run showed both starts cold, because
the workspace-layer pack path `ensureWorkspacePacks()` writes under
`storageDir` is itself a generation input; that is a measurement artefact
of this spike, not a bug -- a real restart's `storageDir` does not move.)

90.8 MB is under the ~150 MB the task set as a "stop and propose trims"
line, so nothing further was trimmed for size alone; `build-vsix.mjs`
still warns past that line if a future change pushes it over. The one
candidate left (drop `packs/*/upstream` media, ~13 MB, the o4d demo's own
images; the zork game data stays, since dropping it breaks the one thing
that pack is for) is still there if it does. Building `output/` on first
start instead of shipping it is no longer a candidate to weigh -- it is
now simply what happens.

**Proving it runs outside this checkout**: `test/vscode-vsix.mjs`
(registered in `test/suites.json`, skipped via `this.skip()` when
`build/vsix` was never built, the same shape `test/osd-binary.mjs` already
uses for the compiled binary) unzips the `.vsix` into a scratch folder
under this checkout's own `.local/` (never `/tmp`), runs
`ensureMaterializedHome()` against a scratch `globalStorageDir` with
`osd.home` unset, and points `Launcher` at a workspace folder
`.local/b0-demo-ws/` (gitignored, created by the test itself if missing:
one abapGit-shaped class, `ZCL_B0_HELLO IMPLEMENTS IF_OO_ADT_CLASSRUN`,
the same fixture this file's own "Live smoke" paragraph describes by
hand). It checks `ZSTG_DEMO_SRV/TravelSet` answers and that `POST
/sap/bc/adt/oo/classrun/ZCL_B0_HELLO` (the same CSRF/session round trip
every other write in this extension already does) prints "hello from the
B0 workspace layer", then stops and checks the spawned pid is actually
gone. Passing, 2026-09-26.

**Installed for real**: `code --install-extension build/vsix/osd-vscode-0.1.0.vsix`
under this machine's Remote-WSL VS Code Server (the `code` on `PATH` here
resolves to the Windows-side binary, which talks to the same server over
the remote bridge) replaced the existing DEV install --
`~/.vscode-server/extensions/open-steamgate.osd-vscode-0.1.0` had been a
symlink to `editors/vscode/` (the usual dev-install shape this same file
names above, since `--extensionDevelopmentPath` is not supported over a
remote connection) -- with a real, extracted 149 MB copy carrying
`extension/osd/`, `engines.vscode` and `extensionKind` read back correctly
off its `package.json`. The dev symlink was restored afterward (`rm` the
extracted copy, `ln -s .../editors/vscode` back in its place) so the usual
edit-and-reload dev loop keeps working; anyone who wants the REAL install
kept instead runs the `--install-extension` command above again and skips
the `ln -s`.

**`engines.vscode`**: `^1.101.0`. `tools/sqlite-file-client.mjs` (the
`STG_DB=file` backend the launcher always selects) imports Node's own
`node:sqlite`, which needs Node 22.5 or newer. Evidence:
[ewanharris/vscode-versions](https://github.com/ewanharris/vscode-versions)
(a maintained table of VS Code's own bundled Electron/Node/Chromium per
release) shows 1.100.0 still on Node 20.19.0 and 1.101.0 (released
2025-06-11) on Node 22.15.1 -- the first VS Code release with Node 22 at
all, and already past 22.5. `extensionKind: ["workspace"]` is set too:
the system has to run where the folder is, never only in a local UI host.

**Left as gaps, not attempted here**: an actual marketplace `publisher`
account and a `CHANGELOG.md` (explicitly out of scope per the task); an
icon distinct from the activity-bar glyph; a non-WSL remote/SSH install
proof (only Remote-WSL was exercised, on this machine); shrinking
`packs/*/upstream`, the one remaining size trim named above; and, per the
"third false start" above, making `describeBuild()`'s "linked" case
portable (branch/commit/dirty, no absolute path) and, separately, a
metadata file at packaging time that would let per-library generation
reuse actually hit, so a materialized first start could be the 4-5 s cache
hit rather than the ~20-23 s cold build it is today (2026-09-26,
`vsix-prebuilt-generation` task; fallback (b) taken on Alice's call within
the hour the task set aside for the portable-hash design).

## Warm

*2026-09-26 (T7).* B0 launches the whole system by itself; this makes the
save-to-serving loop of a system it launched itself under `docs/warm-
compile.md`'s ~0.5 s instead of the cold build's several seconds, and says
so rather than leaving a person to guess whether Ctrl+F3 actually reached
the running process.

**`osd.warm`: `"auto"` (default), `"on"` or `"off"`.** The launcher
(`editors/vscode/launcher.js`) sets `OSD_WARM=1` in the launched system's
own env when the setting resolves to on -- `"auto"` is on at or above
`WARM_MEMORY_FLOOR_BYTES` (4 GB; the prime measured about 0.7 GB,
`docs/warm-compile.md`), off below it (`shouldWarm(mode, totalMemBytes =
os.totalmem())`, pure and unit-tested at both sides of the floor,
`test/vscode-launcher.mjs`). This only asks the launched system to *try*:
whether it actually primes is `tools/osd-store.mjs` `warmUp()`'s own
business, and on the pinned transpiler (no
`abaplint/transpiler#1899`/`#1900`/`#1921`) it stays cold and says why --
that reason is shown as the server gave it, not reworded.

**Where it shows.** `/osd/serving`'s own `warm` field (`{state: off |
priming | primed | cold, reason, generation, unverified, swaps, copies,
lastVerify}`, `tools/osd-store.mjs` `warmStatus()`, #108) drives:
- the status bar, alongside the existing generation and dump count --
  `$(server) osd <gen> · warm +<swaps>` or `· cold: <reason>`, and, for the
  first ~20 s after *this window's own* launch, `$(sync~spin) osd warming
  up…` in place of "osd down" while the prime is still synchronous and the
  façade answers nothing at all (`docs/warm-compile.md`'s own note on
  that);
- the tree's state row (`OsdTreeProvider`), the same text appended to
  "Running on :port, generation …", polled every 5 s while running (the
  prime finishing, or a swap happening, is not a controller state change,
  so nothing else would tell the row it had gone stale);
- both tooltips carry the rest: warm generation, `unverified` (a warm
  build a cold comparison has not passed yet, `X-OSD-Generation:
  <hash> warm-unverified`), `swaps`, `copies` (a warm build that had to
  copy rather than hard-link, `#108`) and `lastVerify`.

`editors/vscode/lib.js` `warmStatusText(warm)` is the pure text (`undefined`
for `"off"` or no field at all -- most machines never turn this on, and a
status bar that says so on every tick would be noise), tested against the
real vocabulary in `test/vscode-extension.mjs`.

**Ctrl+F3 says what it built.** `Osd#activate()`/`#activateMany()` read
`X-OSD-Build`, `X-OSD-Swap-Ms`, `X-OSD-Closure` and `X-OSD-Closure-Tests`
off the activation answer (`tools/adt-facade.mjs` `warmHeaders()`) into
`{build, swapMs, closure, closureTests}`; `activationBuildText(result)`
turns that into "hot-swapped in `<ms>` ms (warm)", "recycled (host-held
module)" (a warm build with no swap header -- a `HOST_HELD` module
recycled the process instead, `docs/warm-compile.md` "What the process
holds itself", not a failure) or "cold build" / "cold build: `<reason>`".
`closureTestsText(result)` is "`<n>` test(s) in the closure", kept on the
result for a later use (B1) and shown in the status-bar message
alongside the build text.

**"Rebuild" (the `$(tools)` icon) is the warm path; "Full rebuild" (the
view's own "…" menu) is the old `osd.rebuild`** (stop, build, start --
unchanged, just moved and renamed so the icon slot is the fast path by
default). `SystemController#rebuildWarm()`:
1. not running -> falls back to `rebuild()`;
2. `/osd/serving`'s `warm.state !== "primed"` -> falls back, and says the
   reason;
3. otherwise asks `GET /sap/bc/adt/core/http/changed` -- every CLAS/INTF
   whose file no longer hashes to what the warm registry was primed or
   last built from (`ObjectStore#changedObjects()`, reusing the warm
   compiler's own per-file digests, `tools/osd-warm.mjs` `WarmCompiler`
   -- no second bookkeeping). `objects: undefined` (not empty) means the
   route itself could not tell, which falls back the same way; an empty
   list means nothing to do;
4. activates every changed object in **one** call
   (`Osd#activateMany`) -- one build, and, warm, one swap, covers the
   whole closure rather than one swap per object, the way a person
   activating a whole change in ADT would.

Every branch above either falls back to a full rebuild or returns having
reported something; nothing here can dump or hang on a system that never
primed -- the fallback runs the same `rebuild()` a plain "not running"
does.

**Tests**: pure logic in `test/vscode-extension.mjs` ("T7 warm status and
build text") and `test/vscode-launcher.mjs` ("shouldWarm"); the live half
in `test/vscode-warm.mjs`, against a real `node test/run.mjs` with
`OSD_WARM=1`, an on-disk comment edit and `Osd#activate()` -- asserts a
warm swap when the registry primed, and that the cold reason is surfaced,
verbatim, when it did not (this checkout's pinned transpiler: `the
transpiler has no \`only\` option (abaplint/transpiler#1900)`).

## Next

- Smart F8 / Runner, the rest of it: create/update/delete entity, a function
  import, `$expand` on the lens's own request. Today's lens and F8 only
  read (Q2b, above).
