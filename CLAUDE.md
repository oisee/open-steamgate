# CLAUDE.md

**open-steamgate** — a local IWBEP / OData runtime that runs real ABAP
`_MPC_EXT` / `_DPC_EXT` classes offline (transpile → Open SQL over SQLite →
OData → Fiori), deploying back through abapGit.

> **Doc intent:** CLAUDE.md = dev context (this file). README.md = the pitch and
> the prior-art matrix. docs/ = research and the layer knowledge we carry over
> from sibling projects. AGENDA.md = what is open and what was decided.

---

## Where this repo is

**CRUD, `$batch`, navigation, `$expand`, deep insert, function imports,
value helps (`Common.ValueList`, `search`), an object page with
PATCH/MERGE semantics and Create below the parent (POST through a
navigation property), a launchpad sandbox (`webapp/flp.html`) with two apps
and intent-based navigation, and read-only SADL (reference data source over CDS projections, with analytics
annotations) work end to end (2026-09-12). The whole thing also runs in the
browser as a preview deployment (service worker + sql.js, GitHub Pages).**
`npm test` transpiles a SEGW-shaped demo MPC/DPC and serves it as OData v2
over `src/gateway/` (URL parser, `$filter` → select-options, request context,
entry provider, model info, JSON (de)serializer, dispatcher). A Fiori Elements
V2 list report in `webapp/` renders it (`npm run e2e`). The research that
scopes the work lives in:
- [`docs/prior-art.md`](docs/prior-art.md) — verified reuse-vs-build matrix,
  gap-list, phased build order, source list (verified-in-repo vs claimed).
- [`docs/layers-we-own.md`](docs/layers-we-own.md) — the SAP-protocol layers
  already reverse-engineered in the sibling projects, with reuse notes.
- [`docs/2026-09-11-lars-ecosystem-audit.md`](docs/2026-09-11-lars-ecosystem-audit.md)
  — hand audit of the open-abap repos (built and probed), the house style to
  copy for Phase 0, ranked quick wins.
- [`AGENDA.md`](AGENDA.md) — the living board: decisions, open questions, the
  Sprint-0 audit checklist.

**Do not start building the runtime without reading `docs/prior-art.md` first.**
The whole point is to reuse the mature substrate and build only the confirmed
gap (the `/IWBEP/` Gateway and the `$filter` bridge). Re-deriving what the
transpiler / fe-mockserver / abapGit already do is the failure mode.

---

## The one thing to internalize

The substrate exists (transpile ABAP → run Open SQL over SQLite → serve UI5) and
is MIT/Apache. The Gateway — everything at and above the `/IWBEP/` line — does
not exist as working code anywhere. **Build only the Gateway and the seam.**

The original build order and how it went (README, "The build order"):
0. Substrate stand-up — done 2026-09-11.
1. Gateway model registry + generic DPC dispatcher — done 2026-09-11.
2. `$filter` → SELECT-OPTIONS / `io_tech_request_context` — done 2026-09-11,
   one commit; the declared critical path was half a day.
3. Wire layer — **dropped on purpose**: no fe-mockserver anywhere. The whole
   request path is ABAP (`src/http/zcl_stg_http_handler` = `if_http_extension`)
   behind `cl_express_icf_shim` on Node and behind the service worker in the
   preview, so the same classes run in a system's ICF.
4. Fiori Elements serving — done 2026-09-11 with the plain SAPUI5 CDN
   bootstrap, no ui5 middleware.

What the long pole actually is: SEGW itself (tree in, tree out, generator,
editor), not the Gateway.

## Scope guards (decided)

- **v1 = classic code-based SEGW only.** Many modern services are SADL-mapped to
  CDS/BOPF and have no hand-written `GET_ENTITYSET` to transpile. Confirm the
  target corpus is code-based before committing to any service.
- **Clean-room.** Reimplement the `/IWBEP/` *interfaces*; bundle no SAP source,
  no standard DDIC. The interface signatures are the contract; the
  implementation is greenfield MIT.
- **SAP systems: only the A4H sandbox, only when Alice asks.** The agent may
  use the A4H MCP server (vsp, `.mcp.json`, gitignored) to build reference
  objects (SEGW sample projects, captures) on explicit request; never a
  productive or customer system, never unasked. The A4H host lives only in
  `.mcp.json`. abapGit stays the last mile for code and for seed-data
  captures; deploy-back is the vsp sibling's territory. (Rule revised
  2026-09-12 by Alice; before that no SAP API was called at all.)
- **Never commit captures** (`*.pcap`, `*.jsonl`) — they carry real logons,
  session GUIDs, credentials. Only protocol facts belong here.
- **Public repo — no live identifiers.** No real hostnames, usernames, IPs,
  transport IDs, or customer namespaces in any tracked file. Operational scratch
  goes under `.local/` (gitignored).
- **The SAP corpus stays local** (Alice, 2026-09-23). Exports and dictionary
  reads from the sandbox (`.local/a4h-export`, `.local/a4h-ddic`) are ours to
  measure against, not to publish: tracked files carry shapes and numbers,
  never the corpus's object names (classes, tables, table types, packages,
  CDS), fragments of its source or DDIC content from it. Field and parameter
  names are fine, and so is an object abapedia.org publishes, with a link.
  The names live in `.local/corpus-names.json` (the teaching/working split
  the instruments read is there too) and in `.local/leak-identifiers.json`,
  so `npm run leak` catches their return. The private share and handovers
  on it may name them. History already in `main` is not rewritten. Scope:
  this rule is about the AMDP corpus; the SAP-delivered SEGW sample projects
  under `.local/corpus-sap`, which docs name as oracles, predate it and are
  not revisited by it -- whether they fall under it too is Alice's call.

## First move (Sprint 0)

Compute the **dependency-closure of 3–5 representative real `_DPC_EXT`
classes** against what `open-abap-core` + `abaplint/deps` already implement.
The critic's finding: this closure (base classes, BAPIs, utils, auth-checks,
message classes) likely dwarfs the `$filter` work and is the real long pole. Do
this before any architectural commitment. See `AGENDA.md` for the checklist.

## Known traps

- `open-abap-odata` is **effectively unlicensed** (`LICENSE` file reads
  `"todo"`, `package.json` license empty). Treat it as a *spec*, not a base:
  reimplement fresh under MIT unless the grant is clarified.
- Transpiler runtime constants — **fixed client 123, SysID ABC, UTC,
  fixed-point** — silently mis-execute any DPC that branches on `sy-mandt` /
  `sy-sysid` / `sy-uzeit`, and there is **no implicit MANDT** (client-dependent
  SELECTs). First-order correctness risk, not an edge.
- Transpiler input must be **ABAP 7.02 syntax**; newer syntax goes through the
  abaplint downport rule first — an extra pipeline step.
- `open-abap-core` has `ASSERT 1 = 'todo'` stub methods. Don't assume any
  `CL_*` / `IF_*` is fully implemented — verify per class.
- fe-mockserver is built *around* mock data files. Checked and not used: the
  wire layer has to be ABAP to run on a system, so there is no dependency on
  it and no data-access plugin. Keep it that way unless something changes.

## Working in the tree

- `npm test` = `abaplint` + transpile + ABAP Unit (inside `output/index.mjs`)
  + mocha wire tests. `npm start` serves `/sap/opu/odata/sap/` on port 3030.
- `abap_transpile.json` pulls open-abap-core, express-icf-shim and the
  interface part of **upstream** `open-abap/open-abap-odata` as libs.
  `folder` points at `.local/lars/` clones when present, else the URL is
  cloned. The fork `oisee/open-abap-odata` is only a staging area for PR
  branches; its `main` tracks upstream. Interface-layer changes: prove them
  here, then one small PR upstream each (open-abap-odata #40–#48, transpiler
  #1829–#1832, all merged 2026-09-12). `oisee` is a collaborator on both
  repos; Lars said self-merging in open-abap-odata is fine (he has no time),
  the transpiler stays his to merge. `open-abap-core` is the exception to the
  branch-not-fork rule below: `oisee` has no write access there (403), so it
  takes a fork (#1218). A
  workaround stays in `src/` or `tools/` only until the fix is on npm.
- **A transpiler PR comes from a branch inside `abaplint/transpiler`, not
  from a fork.** Lars said so on #1836 (2026-09-13, merged the same
  morning): a branch in the repository triggers the performance and
  regression workflows, and a fork's branch does not, so a PR from a fork is
  reviewed with less evidence than one that costs nothing extra to give him.
  The mechanism, read off the workflows rather than taken on trust:
  `regression.yml` triggers on `push` with `branches-ignore: [main]` and has
  no `pull_request` trigger at all, so a fork PR, whose push lands in the
  fork, never fires it; `ci.yml` and `web.yml` do have `pull_request`, which
  is why such a PR still looks green. The check that did not run and the
  check that passed are the same colour. After pushing a branch, confirm
  **Regression** is in the checks list and not only **CI**. That rule holds for
  `abaplint/transpiler`, where we have push rights; it **cannot** be followed for
  `abaplint/abaplint`, where we do not, and whose regression workflow skips forks
  by an explicit condition. `npm run parked` prints which rule applies to which
  repository, so nobody has to remember. The queue of what is
  waiting to go is `npm run parked`, which derives it from the branches in the
  clone and the entries in ANORMALIES rather than from a list somebody keeps:
  it names each parked branch, its commits, whether it has ever been pushed,
  the anomalies that claim it, and it complains in both directions — a branch
  nothing explains, an entry naming a branch that is gone. A branch that is
  not a defect fix explains itself with `git branch --edit-description`, which
  keeps the note on the branch where it cannot drift from it. Entries whose
  fix belongs upstream in abaplint rather than here say **needs an issue** in
  their Upstream line, and `parked` lists those separately.
  `docs/upstream.md` is the dossier: every local fix, its entry, its branch,
  its test and what to do next, in sending order.
  **Sending upstream is gated by a critic, not by an ask** (Alice,
  2026-09-17): before an issue or a PR goes to any of the three upstreams,
  a separate agent reads the drafts against the branch diff (claims vs
  diff, reproducers, live identifiers, tone, whether "no fix proposed" is
  honest); what it flags is fixed, then it is sent and the verdict is
  reported. A merge, a force-push over somebody else's work, or a push to
  a repository that is not ours still asks first.
  The performance test itself is #1837. Pushing a branch there is not
  merging: `main` is still his, and nothing of ours is merged by us in
  `abaplint/transpiler` or `open-abap-core`. Before offering anything to any of
  the three upstreams, run that repository's own `lint`, in a clone with
  nothing uncommitted in it. Two lint errors sat in the shared
  open-abap-core checkout for a day because neither session had run abaplint
  there, and one was an **em dash in an ABAP comment** — ABAP source is
  7-bit ASCII, and the prose style used everywhere else here is the thing
  most likely to break it. The rule is not "write plainer comments", it is
  "run the lint": the check already existed and nobody had asked it.
- **Running it and reading it find different things.** The
  `general_get_random_int` work is the worked example. One session found
  `ASSERT high > low` by calling `cl_abap_random_int` and watching it fail at
  range 1; the other found `ASSERT low >= 0` one line below by reading the
  file they had been pointed at. The first assertion complicated the design
  and the second killed it. Reading alone would have missed nothing here;
  running alone would have shipped the negative range broken. The tests
  written from the A4H measurement do catch that, which is the part worth
  keeping: measuring the contract is what made the tests able to fail.
- Media out of SMW0 works (`docs/adt-facade.md`): a `*.w3mi.*` object in the
  transpile input becomes a row of `wwwparams` plus a file beside the
  modules, and `WWWDATA_IMPORT` + `SCMS_BINARY_TO_XSTRING` carry it into a
  response. Both of the latter needed work in open-abap-core, held in
  `.local/lars/open-abap-core` until the PRs land: `W3MIMETABTYPE` (#1218),
  `SCMS_BINARY_TO_XSTRING` (absent entirely), and `WWWDATA_IMPORT` walked
  with an offset instead of consuming its remainder, which made a 4 MB file
  take minutes and answer nobody meanwhile. Measured after: 4 MB in 0.3 s.
  In a browser there is no file and no `fs`, so `WWWDATA_IMPORT` lets a host
  answer instead: `abap.W3MI_LOADER(objid, filename)` returns the content as
  upper-case hex and the disk is the fallback rather than the only way.
  `scripts/build-preview.mjs` copies `output/*.w3mi.data.*` into
  `build/media/` (29 objects, 11.4 MB) **beside** the bundle, not inside it,
  so a page pays for the audio only if it plays it, and
  `web/preview-backend.mjs` installs the loader. A compiled binary needs the
  same hook for the same reason. Measured in Chromium: a 4.6 MB track in
  0.78 s cold and 0.34 s warm, and Zork boots from `ZORK-MINI.Z3`.
- ABAP goes under `src/` (7.02-compatible, `open-abap` abaplint version),
  tests under `test/unit/*.clas.testclasses.abap`, seed captures under `data/`
  as abapGit TABU JSON (`test/seed.mjs` pads CHAR to DDIC length).
- Every SAP-vs-open-abap discrepancy goes into `ANORMALIES.md` before any
  workaround. Known: no implicit MANDT; `sy-mandt = 123`.
- Closure audit of a real DPC: `npm run probe -- <folder> [--lib <stubs>]`.
- The database seam (`docs/db-backends.md`): the transpiled ABAP talks to one
  object, `abap.context.databaseConnections["DEFAULT"]`, implementing the
  runtime's eleven-method `DatabaseClient`; `test/setup.mjs` chooses it. Two
  implementations exist, `@abaplint/database-sqlite` and
  `tools/duckdb-client.mjs`, and a third needs no change anywhere else.
- `STG_DB=duckdb` runs everything on DuckDB (`tools/duckdb-client.mjs`: real
  LUW with replay-based savepoints, literals trimmed); `STG_DB_PATH=x.duckdb`
  persists; `npm run unit:duckdb`, `start:duckdb`.
- Services register themselves from the SEGW objects: `<srv>.iwsv.xml`
  (service → `_DPC_EXT`) and `<mdl>.iwmo.xml` (model → `_MPC_EXT`) in `src/`,
  abapGit-named; `tools/segw-registry.mjs` (part of `transpile`) writes
  `gen/segw/zcl_stg_segw_registry`, which `test/start.mjs` and the preview
  call. `npm run segw -- <folder> --list` shows what a repo would register.
- Analytics: `ZSTG_FLIGHTFACT` (`data/zstg_flightfact.tabu.json`, 24 seed
  rows) → CDS cube `ZC_STG_FLIGHTCUBE` (`@Analytics.dataCategory: #CUBE`,
  `@Aggregation.default: #SUM`) served by `ZSTG_SADL_SRV`; the SADL runtime
  turns `$select` into `GROUP BY`, gives aggregated rows synthetic keys and
  counts before `$top`. Fiori Elements Analytical List Page in
  `webapp/analytics/` (`/app/analytics/index.html`, launchpad tile "Flight
  analytics"). `STG_DATA_SCALE=1000000` adds synthetic facts
  (`tools/gen-data.mjs`); `npm run bench:cube -- 1000000` times the cube on
  SQLite and DuckDB side by side (`tools/bench-cube.mjs`). Tests
  `test/analytics.mjs`, `test/e2e/analytics.spec.mjs`.
- RFC destinations: `.local/rfc-destinations.json` (example in
  `docs/rfc-destinations.example.json`) says per `DESTINATION` name whether
  it is `local`, `replay` (capture folder), `live` (open-rfc, node only),
  `record` (live + capture written) or `fallback` (local FM if transpiled,
  else live); without the file `'NONE'`/`''` run locally and every other name
  replays `STG_RFC_CAPTURE` (`.local/capture/a4h/rfc`). Capture files are the
  `rfc call` JSON of open-rfc-go (`params` + `result`) and may carry
  `{{param:}}`, `{{now:}}`, `{{seq:}}`, `{{sql:}}` placeholders; see AGENDA
  "RFC replay". `tools/rfc-replay.mjs`, `tools/rfc-live.mjs`; tests
  `test/rfc-replay.mjs`, `test/rfc-live.mjs` (live is faked, A4H only by hand).
- Search helps serve themselves: `<name>.shlp.xml` in `src/` (DD30V selection
  table, DD32P parameters) becomes a `zcl_oao_shlp_ddic` provider through
  `tools/segw-shlp.mjs` (part of `transpile`, writes
  `gen/segw/zcl_stg_shlp_registry`, called by `test/start.mjs` and the
  preview); an operation mapped to a search help reaches it through
  `/iwbep/cl_sb_shlp_data_factory` by name. The demo's `StatusVHSet` runs on
  `ZSTG_STATUS_SH` this way. Exit search helps are not served yet.
- SEGW offline: `npm run segw:gen -- <folder> --check` diffs what
  `tools/segw-gen.mjs` makes of a `<project>.iwpr.xml` against the `_MPC`/
  `_DPC` classes in the folder; `--out <dir>` writes them (and the `_EXT`
  pair if missing); `--lib <folder>` (repeatable) supplies the abapGit
  function groups (`*.fugr.xml`) the RFC-mapped operations need
  (`tools/segw-gen-mapping.mjs`: RFC/BOR and search-help data sources,
  `docs/segw-mapping.md`). SAP-delivered sample projects exported from A4H
  live under `.local/corpus-sap/` (never tracked) and are the oracle for
  the mapped kinds. Corpus projects under `.local/corpus/` are the oracle;
  `npm run segw:closure` generates every corpus project and lints it
  against open-abap-odata (`docs/segw-closure.md`), skips without corpus
  (`--corpus <dir>` for another folder of repos, e.g. `.local/corpus-sap`);
  it also uses `.local/lars/s4-private-2022-doma-and-dtel` (abapedia's
  S/4 DOMA/DTEL dump) when cloned. DDIC upstream rule: released data
  elements → open-abap-core, the rest → open-abap-deprecated.
- `npm run stg:compile -- <service>.stg.yaml [--out <dir>]` is SEGW without
  the GUI: one YAML → IWPR + IWSV/IWMO + the four classes through segw-gen
  (`tools/stg-compile.mjs`, `docs/stg-compile.md`); the demo's model is
  `src/demo/zstg_demo.stg.yaml`, `test/stg-compile.mjs` keeps it in step
  with the hand-written classes. Sources per entity: none, `struct:`,
  `table:`/`cds:` (SADL), `service:`+`set:` (another service of the
  registry, consumed in-process through `zcl_stg_odata_client`; the local
  ODC, `src/demo_odc/` is a YAML-only example); per operation
  `function:`/`searchhelp:` with `in`/`out`/`ranges`/`constants` = SEGW's
  data-source mapping (module signature from a `*.fugr.xml` next to the
  YAML or `--lib`); `annotations:` (header, selectionFields, lineItem,
  facets, fieldGroups, label/text/valueList per property) become
  `ZCL_<project>_MPC_ANN` over `vocab_anno_model`, called from the
  `_MPC_EXT`, so the Fiori apps need no local annotation file;
  `complexTypes:` (SBO_CT, a property `type: <complex type>`, a function
  `returns: {complexType:}`). The tree is written in SEGW's own shape
  (fields and order from `src/segw/segw-tables.json`).
  `stg-compile --all` runs in `transpile`: YAML under `src/` compiles into
  `gen/stg/` unless `src/` already holds the object (a stale generated copy
  of an object `src/` now holds is removed).
- CDS views go under `src/cds/*.ddls.asddls` (+ `.ddls.xml`); `npm run cds`
  (part of `transpile`) generates `gen/cds/` (DDIC view XML under the SQL
  view name *and* under the CDS name, source classes with `ty_row`/`tt_row`,
  the registry). `gen/` is not tracked. SADL runtime lives in `src/sadl/`.
  `@ObjectModel.virtualElement` + `virtualElementCalculatedBy: 'ABAP:ZCL_X'`
  on a `cast( )` element is a field an ABAP class fills after the read
  (`docs/virtual-elements.md`, `if_sadl_exit_calc_element_read`);
  `@OData.publish: true` on a view writes `gen/cds/<view>_cds.stg.yaml`,
  which `stg-compile --all` turns into a service (`docs/cds-publish.md`);
  `@ObjectModel.writeEnabled` on a projection of one table makes it writable
  (`docs/cds-writes.md`), and the dispatcher answers 405 for a write the
  model does not allow.
- `table:` sources are read and written generically: `tools/cds2ddic.mjs`
  emits `gen/cds/zcl_stg_tab_<table>` (read / insert / update / delete over
  the table, `zif_stg_cds_source`) for every TABL under `src/`, and
  `zcl_stg_sadl_dpc` serves POST / PUT / DELETE / GET by key for the
  generated DDIC-mapped DPCs (keys checked, MANDT set, duplicates and
  unknown keys are 400). `src/segw/` is SEGW as an application on top of
  that (`docs/segw-tree.md`): the 53 tables of the project tree
  (`ZSTG_SBD_*` / `ZSTG_SBO_*`) and `ZSTG_SEGW_SRV` are generated by
  `npm run segw:tables` from `src/segw/segw-tables.json`, a spec derived
  from 21 real SEGW projects (`--derive`, fields in SEGW's order, CHAR of
  the size class seen, `STG_SEQ` for the row order); edit the spec, not
  the tables or the YAML (`--check` and `test/segw-tree.mjs` guard it).
  `npm run segw:tree import <file.iwpr.xml>` puts a project into
  `data/zstg_sb*.tabu.json` (seeded at start), `export <PROJECT>` writes it
  back byte-identically for every SEGW-written file; `data/` holds the
  mapped fixture. `push <file>` / `pull <PROJECT>` do the same through a
  running gateway: `POST ImportSet` with the file as `Content`
  (`zcl_stg_segw_import` via the hand-written `zcl_zstg_segw_dpc_ext` in
  `src/segw/`, kept by `stg-compile --all`), `GET ExportSet('P')` for the
  pull (`zcl_stg_segw_export`, the file written in ABAP); `DELETE
  NodeSet(P, uuid)` removes a node with its subtree (`zcl_stg_segw_tree`);
  `GET RepoFileSet?$filter=Project eq 'P'` (or `RepoSet('P')` as a zip, or
  `npm run segw:tree repo <P> --out <dir>`) is the project as an abapGit
  repository, which is how it reaches a system (`zcl_stg_segw_repo`);
  `GET GenerateSet?$filter=Project eq 'P'` is segw-gen in ABAP
  (`zcl_stg_segw_gen` + `zcl_stg_segw_gen_dpc` + `zcl_stg_segw_gen_rfc`:
  MPC, DPC with RFC and search-help bodies, XML, EXT pair), byte-identical
  to `tools/segw-gen.mjs` by test; module signatures come from
  `ZSTG_FM_PARAM`, filled by `POST FunctionGroupSet` with a `*.fugr.xml`
  (`zcl_stg_segw_fugr`). `npm run segw:cloud` is the informational abaplint pass
  with `syntax.version: Cloud`. `test/unit/zcl_stg_segw_test` is the CRUD
  round trip (`ltcl_crud`) and the served tree (`ltcl_tree`).
- The RFC channel (`docs/rfc-channel.md`, backlog D.1): one ICF service,
  `ZOSD_RFC` at `/sap/bc/osd/rfc/`, calls any remote-enabled function module
  of the tree over JSON. `GET /functions` is the catalogue, `GET
  /functions/<NAME>` the signature, `POST /call/<NAME>` the call
  (`{IMPORTING, CHANGING, TABLES}` in, `{EXPORTING, CHANGING, TABLES}` or
  `{EXCEPTION}` out). `tools/osd-fm-registry.mjs` (part of `transpile`,
  `npm run osd:fm -- --list`) reads the `*.fugr.xml` the way
  `segw-registry.mjs` reads `*.iwsv.xml` and writes `gen/rfc/`: the registry
  and a **generated** typed dispatcher, because the transpiler resolves a
  `CALL FUNCTION`'s parameter list at transpile time and has no
  `PARAMETER-TABLE`. No `<REMOTE_CALL>R</REMOTE_CALL>`, no call — the channel
  answers 403 and the dispatcher has no method for it. A classic exception is
  a field of a 200, not an HTTP error: the module ran and declined, and only
  a system failure is a broken call. No RFC wire, no SOAP envelope and no
  authentication yet; do not put it on a public address.
- SAP Easy Access is served by ABAP at `/sap/bc/gui/sap/its/webgui/`
  (`src/webgui/zcl_osd_webgui`, `docs/webgui.md`, backlog track G): the path
  the real ITS webgui answers on, used on purpose. The tree is **read out of
  the five status tables** (`ZOSD_SVC`, `ZOSD_PACK`, `ZOSD_SYS`) rather than
  walked again, so there is one inventory and the menu cannot disagree with
  the status app; `ZOSD_SVC` gained a `TEXT` column and `KIND = 'APP'` rows
  (from each app's own `manifest.json`, at its own inbound intent). A node
  has a kind — FOLDER / APP / SERVICE / TRANSACTION — and the command field
  is resolved server-side against the same node list. `open-abap-gui` (the
  SAP GUI control substitutes) is a **lib**, not a pack, from `oisee/` at
  `ed96e89`, `/src` plus the three `scaffold` files `/src` names: +301
  objects. Its `sapevent` rewrite works outbound; **nothing in it ever
  raises the event**, so the next step is proving a click comes back against
  abapGit's own HTML (G.2), and running abapGit is not started.
- Media entities (`docs/media-entities.md`): `set_is_media` in the MPC,
  `m:HasStream` in `$metadata`, `<entity>/$value` served by the DPC's
  `GET_STREAM` / `UPDATE_STREAM` (`zcl_stg_dispatcher=>media`, the binary
  body travels as `ty_response-body_x`), `media_src` / `edit_media` in the
  JSON. The demo's `PhotoSet` over `ZSTG_PHOTO` (seeded PNGs as hex) is one;
  `UI.IsImageURL` on `Travel/PhotoUrl` is what makes the Travels app show
  the picture in the list and in the object page header.
- The SEGW editor is `webapp/segw/` (`docs/segw-editor.md`): freestyle
  SAPUI5 over `ZSTG_SEGW_SRV`, the project tree in SEGW's shape, every
  node edited in place (MERGE), Create for entity types, sets (with their
  operations), associations, navigation properties, function imports,
  parameters and properties, Delete = `NodeSet` subtree delete, Import IWPR through
  `ImportSet` (a `*.fugr.xml` through `FunctionGroupSet`), Export IWPR
  through `ExportSet`, Generate through `GenerateSet` (segw-gen in ABAP);
  "Save to gen/" is the one dev route of `test/start.mjs`
  (`POST /segw/generate/<P>`, `tools/segw-editor.mjs` writes the rows of
  `GenerateSet` to `gen/segw-editor/`, which the transpiler and abaplint
  skip). Launchpad tile "SEGW"
  (`SegwProject-manage`); `test/e2e/segw.spec.mjs`. Tests and the
  Playwright config read `STG_PORT` like `test/start.mjs`, so two sessions
  can run their suites side by side on different ports.
- `npm run web:preview` bundles the gateway into a service worker (`build/preview/`,
  sql.js, no server); `npm run e2e:preview` checks it in Chromium; the
  `preview deployment` workflow publishes `main/` and `pr-<n>/` to GitHub
  Pages. See `docs/preview-deployments.md`. `build/` and `web/generated/` are
  not tracked.
- **webpack stays for the preview; do not swap it for Bun.** Measured
  2026-09-14 (`docs/bun-spike.md` part two): Bun bundles the same graph in
  337 ms against webpack's 56 s and the output cannot be evaluated, because
  it keeps `import.meta` and 8893 top-level awaits and a service worker is a
  classic script. webpack lowers both. Ten of its jobs are load-bearing —
  sixteen node-builtin polyfills, `symlinks: false`, the sql.js asm alias,
  three specifier rewrites, the DuckDB ignore, `Buffer`/`process`, one chunk,
  and Terser with `keep_classnames`/`keep_fnames`, which is not cosmetic
  because the runtime looks classes up by name. None of this touches the
  binary, where a module target makes both constructs legal, and where the
  `%23` defect turned out **not** to block packaging: `Bun.build({compile,
  plugins})` with a five-line `onResolve` builds a binary that runs.
- **A pack is a directory, not a rebuild** (backlog E.2, `tools/osd-packs.mjs`):
  a folder with an `osd-pack.json` in it, holding ABAP (`src/`), seed rows
  (`data/`), table definitions (`src/ddic/`) and a page (`webapp/`). Packs are
  found in `packs/` and in whatever `OSD_PACKS` names, and layered after the
  folders `abap_transpile.json` lists, so a pack wins a name it shares and the
  build says so. A pack's objects live in a package of its own, its rows are
  seeded, its page is served at `/app/<name>`, and the generation hash covers
  it — `node tools/osd-packs.mjs` lists what is there. Generators read
  **content** (`src` plus each pack), never the whole layer list: one that read
  `test/` picked up a CDS fixture and failed the build.
  A pack may **fetch** a folder instead of carrying it: `sources` in the
  manifest (repository, commit, path, exclude patterns), `node
  tools/osd-fetch.mjs` copies it into `<pack>/upstream/` (ignored), the
  pack's own `src/` layers over it, and a build or a preview refuses a
  pack that was not fetched (`UNFETCHED`). `packs/o4d` and `packs/zork`
  are two such manifests plus an overlay; the GitHub Pages workflow
  fetches them, which is how the demo and Zork are on the public preview
  without their sources being in this repository (2026-09-17).
- **The binary is `npm run binary` → `build/osd`** (`bin/osd.mjs`,
  `scripts/build-binary.mjs`, `docs/bun-spike.md` part three, 2026-09-16):
  `build/osd up|serve|build|gen <tool>|unit|doctor`. Four facts a change
  must respect. A compiled Bun binary resolves nothing from a
  `node_modules` beside an external module and its `onResolve` never sees
  a bare specifier, so code generated after the build gets
  `@abaplint/runtime` from a runtime plugin's `build.module` (the binary's
  own copy, one runtime object for host and generated code) and
  `../test/setup.mjs` from `onResolve` by path. Every bundled module shares
  one `import.meta.url` and `process.execPath` is the binary, so a tool
  starts another tool only through `tools/osd-host.mjs`, never by
  `spawn(process.execPath, <script>)` or a path off `import.meta.url`
  (`osd-transpile`'s glob, `stg-compile`'s spec, `start.mjs`'s `webapp`
  were all moved off it). The bundle renames a class whose name collides
  (`types.Date` → `Date2`) and the runtime compares `constructor.name`,
  so `bin/osd.mjs` restores the names and `osd doctor` lists what was
  renamed. Interpreted `bun x.mjs` auto-installs from `~/.bun` when there
  is no node_modules — measure with `--no-install`. And a generator's
  output must not depend on `readdirSync` order (Bun's differs from
  Node's): `gen/` is an input to the generation hash, and the two hosts
  named different generations until every directory read was sorted.
- A page that speaks APC gets `open` before `drain`. A stateful handler
  speaks from `on_start`, so draining what it pushed before signalling open
  delivers a message while the page's socket is still CONNECTING: `onmessage`
  runs before `onopen` and the page's reply is refused as "the socket is not
  open". The page is right; the ordering was wrong (`web/preview-backend.mjs`).
- **A rule written once, next to its one caller, does not survive the second
  caller.** The end of a dialog step -- commit when the work is done, roll
  back when it ends in an exception nobody declared -- was written correctly
  in `tools/osd-serve.mjs`, with a comment ending "This is the rule, said
  once." It was said once, in one host out of three. `test/start.mjs`'s
  inline front and `web/preview-backend.mjs` were written afterwards and
  neither copied it, so there a request that dumped left its rows pending on
  the connection and the **next** modifying request's fencing `COMMIT WORK`
  adopted them: a half-write that becomes permanent one request later and
  looks like nothing in between. It is the kernel's job and not the
  application's -- on a system such an exception is a short dump and a dump
  ends the LUW -- so it now lives in `tools/osd-dialog-step.mjs` and all
  three hosts call it (`docs/luw-buffer.md`, test in `test/mocha.mjs`,
  checked failing without it). The general form: when a rule is about **what
  every host must do**, a comment saying so is not where it goes; a module
  they all import is.
- **Verify a built artefact by its code, never by a comment, and never by
  the build command exiting 0.** Three false greens in one day, 2026-09-14,
  all the same shape: a test that called `install()` itself and passed while
  the injected path it claimed to cover was broken; a suite that passed
  against a stale `build/sw.js`; and a fix "confirmed" by grepping for a
  comment webpack strips. A deployed bundle is checked by content, and a
  test must exercise the real path rather than simulate it. Backlog 8.4.
- **The `input_folder` list of `abap_transpile.json` is the layer order,
  and the later folder wins** — for the transpiler, the builder and the
  object store alike (backlog E.1, 2026-09-16). Only listed folders are the
  system: a folder under `local/` that is not listed is in nobody's tree,
  and an import appends its folder to the list. The builder hands the
  transpiler the winner of a name only (the rest go into the build's
  `exclude_filter`) and logs every override with both files; the same file
  name twice inside one folder refuses the build. `node tools/osd-inputs.mjs`
  prints overrides, duplicates and shadows. Measured before deciding: the
  raw transpiler writes the later folder's module last, and abaplint's
  registry files the first and calls the second "already defined" — a
  duplicate left to either is a guess.
- **The demo is an oracle for the runtime** (`docs/frame-comparison.md`):
  ZO4D answers a frame per tick as JSON, the same ABAP on A4H answers the
  same, and `tools/o4d-record.mjs --scene <name> --ticks n` on both sides
  plus `--compare` names the ABAP that computed a difference. Eight
  anomalies in two days came out of it (2026-09-16/17); every one was
  then measured on A4H with a throwaway ABAP Unit probe before anything
  was changed. Recordings stay under `.local/`.
- **Three traps of a long session, each paid for on 2026-09-17**
  (`docs/retro-2026-09-17.md` has the rest): a pack asset never takes an
  extension `.gitignore` names (`*.jsonl` swallowed the light-show
  recording, green here and red on the runner; it is `.ndjson`); a page
  written from ABAP in backtick literals gets no escapes (`\n` reaches
  JavaScript as two characters; use `String.fromCharCode(10)`) and must
  not name a variable after a window property (`status` is
  `window.status`); and a server that must outlive a command is started
  `setsid nohup … & disown`, since the harness reaps its own background
  tasks and a plain `&` dies with the shell.
- **A system is reached with a zip, and the last mile is measured**
  (`docs/a4h-deploy.md`, 2026-09-19). `npm run segw:zip` builds an abapGit
  offline repository out of a compiled project; `.local/make-level.sh <nnn>`
  builds one numbered attempt, because a failed import leaves rows in
  `/IWBEP/I_MGW_SRG` and the next attempt with the same names dumps on them
  -- so every attempt gets its own package and its own prefix. What a real
  system checks and this runtime does not: a versioned file name is a fixed
  width (IWSV 39, IWMO/IWVB 36) **and a prefix rename loses it**; a BSP
  application name is at most 15 because it becomes an `ICFNAME`; a generic
  `TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF x` may not be a structure component; a date is
  `TYPE_KIND D` + `TYPE_NAME` in the tree and not an `Edm.DateTime` with a
  precision; a class may only call an interface it implements, and where the
  `INTERFACES` line belongs is counted in the corpus (8 of 8 for
  `IF_SB_DPC_COMM_SERVICES`, 0 of 8 for `IF_SB_GENDPC_SHLP_DATA`, which is
  conditional on a mapped search help); a seed row for another client is
  rewritten into the logon client, so it must not travel. A Fiori app goes
  as a BSP application (`tools/osd-bsp-app.mjs`, format read off
  `ZUI5_CODE_SEA` in the corpus) **plus its ICF node** -- abapGit creates the
  application and not the node, and has no UI5-repository integration at all,
  but a node is an ordinary SICF object with no handler, and abapGit inserts
  it already active. Going the other way, `tools/osd-remote-service.mjs`
  answers a service this registry lacks out of a destination on this origin,
  carrying the CSRF token **with** its session cookie, which is the pair a
  write needs.
- Never put real `_DPC_EXT` sources or captures under a tracked path; use
  `.local/`.
- **Decode before you scan.** `npm run leak` (`tools/osd-leak-scan.mjs`, hook in
  `.githooks/`, CI in `leak-scan.yml`) looks for live identifiers in what is
  about to be published. It exists because a 746-byte logon template was
  committed to a public repo carrying a system's host name, instance, address,
  logon string and user, and a hand scan written to catch exactly that called
  it clean: the scan looked for runs of printable ASCII and every string in the
  structure was **UTF-16LE**. A NUL after each character hides a host name from
  a grep and from an eye. So the tool builds every byte view a file plausibly
  has — the text, the hex runs in it, the base64 blocks, each read as ASCII and
  as UTF-16LE — and matches over all of them. A sixth identifier was not a
  string at all: the last six bytes of a session GUID are the client's own IPv4
  packed into the uuid's node field, which no text search can see, so private
  addresses are matched in binary too (the two-byte prefixes only — a 10.x
  match is one byte and any random blob produces one per 256, and a check that
  cries wolf gets ignored). The identifier list is gitignored
  (`.local/leak-identifiers.json`): a list of what must not be published cannot
  itself be published, and the tool says so and exits 2 rather than passing
  quietly when it is absent. **It takes its file list from git, so it cannot
  see what is not tracked**, and the text most likely to be published is
  exactly that: a draft of an issue under `.local/`, about to be pasted into a
  public tracker. Asked to scan such a folder it used to answer "0 files, 0
  matches", which reads like a pass; `--paths <path>…` reads them whatever git
  knows, and a scan that read nothing now says so and exits 2 rather than
  printing the clean line (2026-09-17). `.leak-allow.json` **is** tracked and every entry
  needs a reason, so an exception can be told from a way of making the build
  green. The rule "no live identifiers" had been in this file since the first
  week and did no work at all; both times it was attention that caught the
  leak, and attention is what runs out.

## Local clones

`.local/lars/` (gitignored) holds shallow clones of the abaplint / open-abap /
larshp repos, five of them built (`npm test` green except Playwright). Use them
for source reads instead of GitHub fetches.

## Substrate (when code starts)

What it actually is: Node 22/24, `@abaplint/transpiler` called as a library
(`tools/osd-transpile.mjs`, N3; the CLI stays installed for hand runs) +
`@abaplint/database-sqlite` (+ `@duckdb/node-api`, `sql.js` for the browser),
`express` with `cl_express_icf_shim`, `mocha`/`chai` and `@playwright/test`.
No `@sap-ux/*`, no `@ui5/cli`: SAPUI5 comes from SAP's CDN and `webapp/` is
plain files. The one runtime dependency is `open-rfc` (live RFC, Node only).
