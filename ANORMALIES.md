# open-abap and transpiler anomaly log

Behaviour that differs between a real SAP system and open-abap / the abaplint
transpiler / its database adapter. Add an entry as soon as the discrepancy is
isolated and before hiding it behind a workaround. Ordinary open-steamgate
defects that reproduce identically on both runtimes do not belong here.

Resolved entries stay as compatibility history. Review all open entries before
upgrading `@abaplint/*` and before every release.

Format adapted from `larshp/hithub` (MIT).

## Open anomalies

### ANOMALY-2026-09-11-no-implicit-mandt — Client-dependent tables are read across all clients

- Status: `open`
- Discovery date: `2026-09-11`
- Affected versions: `@abaplint/transpiler-cli 2.13.85`, `@abaplint/runtime 2.13.85`, `@abaplint/database-sqlite 2.13.83`
- Affected ABAP statement, runtime API or adapter: `SELECT` on a table with `CLIDEP = X`; `sy-mandt` is the constant `123` (`runtime/src/builtin/sy.ts`)
- Minimal ABAP reproducer: `src/demo/zcl_zstg_demo_dpc_ext.clas.abap` `travelset_get_entityset` against `data/zstg_demo.tabu.json` (3 rows in client 123, 1 in client 001)
- Exact command used to run it: `npm run unit`
- Expected SAP behaviour: 3 rows; the database interface adds `MANDT = sy-mandt` to every Open SQL statement on a client-dependent table unless `CLIENT SPECIFIED`
- Actual open-abap behaviour: 4 rows; no client predicate is generated, `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` likewise touch every client
- Impact on open-steamgate: every real business table is client-dependent; a seeded multi-client capture leaks rows across clients, and any DPC that branches on `sy-mandt` sees `123`
- Smallest safe workaround: seed captures with a single client and set every row's `mandt` to `123`; do not rely on client isolation in tests
- Upstream issue: not reported yet; check `abaplint/transpiler` for an existing MANDT issue before opening one
- Regression-test location: `test/unit/zcl_stg_phase0_test.clas.testclasses.abap` `entityset_reads_sqlite` pins the current 4-row result and will fail when the runtime starts filtering
- Upstream version containing a fix: `unknown`

### ANOMALY-2026-09-11-oao-handler-hardcodes-test-dpc — open-abap-odata cannot be consumed as a library

- Status: `workaround`
- Discovery date: `2026-09-11`
- Affected versions: `open-abap/open-abap-odata` main at `7b20ba2` (2026-08-27)
- Affected ABAP statement, runtime API or adapter: `zcl_oao_http_handler=>data` declares `lo_dpc TYPE REF TO zcl_zsegw_dpc_ext`, a class that only exists in that repo's `test/` folder
- Minimal ABAP reproducer: add the repo as a lib in `abap_transpile.json` without `exclude_filter`
- Exact command used to run it: `npm run transpile`
- Expected SAP behaviour: n/a (library packaging)
- Actual open-abap behaviour: `Error: CreateObjectTranspiler, target variable "lo_dpc" not a object reference`
- Impact on open-steamgate: blocks using the interface transcription as a lib
- Smallest safe workaround: `"exclude_filter": ["zcl_oao_http_handler"]` on the lib entry (applied)
- Upstream issue: https://github.com/open-abap/open-abap-odata/issues/33 (open, same crash); QW1 in `AGENDA.md` is the fix, sent upstream as https://github.com/open-abap/open-abap-odata/pull/40 (merged 2026-09-12)
- Regression-test location: `npm run transpile` itself
- Upstream version containing a fix: open-abap-odata main from 5467424 (2026-09-12); open-steamgate consumes upstream directly since #48

### ANOMALY-2026-09-11-doubled-quote-literal — A literal holding two quotes is transpiled as one character

- Status: `fixed` in `@abaplint/transpiler` 2.13.86 (2026-09-12); workaround removed the same day
- Discovery date: `2026-09-11`
- Affected versions: `@abaplint/transpiler-cli 2.13.85`
- Affected ABAP statement, runtime API or adapter: any character literal whose content is escaped quotes, e.g. `''''''` (two quotes) used in `REPLACE ALL OCCURRENCES OF '''''' IN lv WITH ''''`
- Minimal ABAP reproducer (inline):

  ```abap
  rv_result = `x''y`.
  REPLACE ALL OCCURRENCES OF '''''' IN rv_result WITH ''''.
  " SAP: x'y   open-abap: x''y
  ```

- Exact command used to run it: `abap_transpile` + `node output/index.mjs` on a class with the two lines above in a FOR TESTING method
- Expected SAP behaviour: `''''''` is a `c LENGTH 2` literal containing `''`; the replace yields `x'y`
- Actual open-abap behaviour: the literal is emitted as `abap.CharacterFactory.get(1, '\'\'')`, a `c LENGTH 1`, so the pattern degenerates to a single quote and the statement is a no-op. Length is computed before the escape sequence is folded.
- Impact on open-steamgate: OData key predicates and `$filter` literals escape quotes by doubling; un-doubling silently failed
- Smallest safe workaround: build the two-quote string at runtime, `lv_two = |''|`, and use the variable in `REPLACE` (was applied in `zcl_stg_url`, `zcl_stg_json`, `zcl_stg_request_context`, `zcl_stg_sadl_dpc`; the literal is back since 2.13.86)
- Upstream issue: https://github.com/abaplint/transpiler/pull/1829 (fix + test, open 2026-09-12)
- Regression-test location: `test/unit/zcl_stg_gateway_test.clas.testclasses.abap` `ltcl_url->keys_named`
- Upstream version containing a fix: 2.13.86

### ANOMALY-2026-09-12-fae-dedupe-by-db-key — FOR ALL ENTRIES de-duplicates by the DB key on the target table

- Status: `fixed` in `@abaplint/transpiler` 2.13.86 (2026-09-12); workaround removed the same day
- Discovery date: `2026-09-12`
- Affected versions: `@abaplint/transpiler-cli 2.13.85`, `@abaplint/runtime 2.13.85`
- Affected ABAP statement, runtime API or adapter: `SELECT <fields> FROM tab INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE lt FOR ALL ENTRIES IN ...` where the target line type lacks a key field of `tab` (typically MANDT)
- Minimal ABAP reproducer: `src/demo/zcl_zstg_demo_dpc_ext.clas.abap` `get_expanded_entityset` before this entry's workaround
- Exact command used to run it: `npm run unit`
- Expected SAP behaviour: the union of the per-entry selects with duplicates removed, target fields filled by name
- Actual open-abap behaviour: the generated code runs `SORT lt BY mandt travel_id booking_id` + `DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES` with the DB key's component names on the *target* table: `Error: sort compare, wrong component name, mandt`
- Impact on open-steamgate: any DPC that FAE-selects into a projection structure crashes the request; very common in hand-written DPCs
- Smallest safe workaround: select into a table typed like the DB table (`TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF tab`) and MOVE-CORRESPONDING afterwards (was applied in the demo; `INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS` is back since 2.13.86)
- Upstream issue: https://github.com/abaplint/transpiler/pull/1830 (fix + test, open 2026-09-12)
- Regression-test location: `test/unit/zcl_stg_gateway_test.clas.testclasses.abap` `ltcl_navigation->expand_by_the_dpc`
- Upstream version containing a fix: 2.13.86

### ANOMALY-2026-09-12-fae-empty-driver — FOR ALL ENTRIES with an empty driving table throws

- Status: `fixed` in `@abaplint/transpiler` 2.13.86 (2026-09-12); workaround removed the same day
- Discovery date: `2026-09-12`
- Affected versions: `@abaplint/transpiler-cli 2.13.85`
- Affected ABAP statement, runtime API or adapter: `SELECT ... FOR ALL ENTRIES IN lt` with `lt` empty
- Minimal ABAP reproducer: the same SELECT as above with an empty `lt_travel` (guarded by `IF lt_travel IS NOT INITIAL` in the demo)
- Exact command used to run it: `npm run unit` without the guard
- Expected SAP behaviour: the WHERE condition with the FAE table is dropped, all rows are selected (the classic FAE trap)
- Actual open-abap behaviour: `throw new Error("FAE, todo, empty table")` in the generated code
- Impact on open-steamgate: a DPC that relies on the SAP behaviour (or forgets the guard) crashes instead of over-selecting
- Smallest safe workaround: guard every FAE with `IF lt IS NOT INITIAL`, as good ABAP does anyway (kept: since 2.13.86 an unguarded empty driver selects everything, like on SAP)
- Upstream issue: https://github.com/abaplint/transpiler/pull/1832 (SAP semantics: empty driver ignores the WHERE; Lars may prefer an option, offered in the PR)
- Regression-test location: none
- Upstream version containing a fix: 2.13.86

### ANOMALY-2026-09-12-create-data-ddic-view — CREATE DATA with a DDIC view type is unknown at runtime

- Status: `fixed` in `@abaplint/transpiler` 2.13.86 (2026-09-12); workaround removed the same day
- Discovery date: `2026-09-12`
- Affected versions: `@abaplint/transpiler-cli 2.13.85`, `@abaplint/runtime 2.13.85`
- Affected ABAP statement, runtime API or adapter: `CREATE DATA rr TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF <ddic view>` (VIEW object)
- Minimal ABAP reproducer: `tools/cds2ddic.mjs` generated source classes before this entry's workaround
- Exact command used to run it: `npm run unit`
- Expected SAP behaviour: a table of the view's line type
- Actual open-abap behaviour: `Error: CREATE DATA, unknown type ZVSTGTRAVEL` (the transpiler resolves the view statically for SELECT, but the runtime DDIC lookup has no entry for views)
- Impact on open-steamgate: generic code that creates data by a view name fails
- Smallest safe workaround: declare `TYPES ty_line TYPE <view>` in the class and `CREATE DATA ... TYPE ty_line` / a local table type (was applied in the generator; `CREATE DATA ... TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF <view>` is back since 2.13.86)
- Upstream issue: https://github.com/abaplint/transpiler/pull/1831 (two fixes: views were never imported by the init script, and the runtime ignored the TABLE flag for static DDIC names, so plain `CREATE DATA ... TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF t100` was broken too)
- Regression-test location: `test/unit/zcl_stg_gateway_test.clas.testclasses.abap` `ltcl_sadl->entity_set_with_filter`
- Upstream version containing a fix: 2.13.86

### ANOMALY-2026-09-13-conv-second-in-expression — The second constructor expression in one expression has no type

- Status: `fixed locally, not released`
- Discovery date: `2026-09-13`
- Affected versions: `@abaplint/transpiler 2.13.86`, `@abaplint/core 2.120.5`
- Affected ABAP statement, runtime API or adapter: `CONV` (and any constructor expression resolved through an inferred type) when more than one appears in one expression
- Minimal ABAP reproducer: `foo = CONV f( 1 ) + CONV f( 2 ).`
- Exact command used to run it: `npx abap_transpile` over oisee/vivid-vibes; isolated with the transpiler's own `runSingle`
- Expected SAP behaviour: both are floats; ABAP has no opinion about how many of them fit in a statement
- Actual open-abap behaviour: the transpile ends with `TypeNameOrInfer, type not found: f`. The syntax check records an InferredType reference for the first name and none for the rest, and the transpiler had nothing else to fall back on
- Impact on open-steamgate: none of ours; 786 uses of `CONV f(` across 69 files of vivid-vibes, 136 of them with two in one expression, so the demo payload did not transpile at all
- Smallest safe workaround: split the expression into two statements
- Upstream issue: none yet, PR deferred by Alice 2026-09-13. Fixed in a local branch of the transpiler (`fix/conv-builtin-type`): a built-in type name that names exactly one type (`i`, `f`, `string`, `xstring`, `d`, `t`, `int8`, `utclong`, `decfloat16/34`) is enough on its own when no reference was recorded
- Regression-test location: the transpiler's `test/single_statements.ts`, local branch
- Upstream version containing a fix: `unknown`

### ANOMALY-2026-09-13-paren-before-conv — A parenthesised group before `* CONV ... /` generates unbalanced JavaScript

- Status: `fixed locally, not released`
- Discovery date: `2026-09-13`
- Affected versions: `@abaplint/transpiler 2.13.86`
- Affected ABAP statement, runtime API or adapter: arithmetic where a constructor expression sits between two operators
- Minimal ABAP reproducer: `foo = ( 1 - 2 ) * CONV f( 3 ) / 256.`
- Exact command used to run it: `npx abap_transpile`; the generated module then fails to parse with `Private field '#x' must be declared in an enclosing class`, which is V8 recovering from unbalanced parentheses somewhere above
- Expected SAP behaviour: `(( 1 - 2 ) * conv) / 256`, left to right
- Actual open-abap behaviour: the emitted JavaScript drops `( 1 - 2 ) *` and closes one bracket too many. The rearranger flattens a nested arithmetic Source into its parent so precedence can be decided across the whole chain, and a constructor expression is five children rather than one, so its type name and body landed beside the operators and were read as operands
- Impact on open-steamgate: none of ours; 15 of 85 effect classes in vivid-vibes emitted modules that could not be imported, and one broken module breaks the whole runtime because `init.mjs` imports every class
- Smallest safe workaround: assign the constructor expression to a variable first
- Upstream issue: none yet, PR deferred. Fixed in the same local branch: the head of the flattened chain is wrapped back into one Source before it is hoisted
- Regression-test location: the transpiler's `test/single_statements.ts`, local branch
- Upstream version containing a fix: `unknown`

### ANOMALY-2026-09-13-builtin-as-method — A built-in function in such an expression is emitted as a method of the class

- Status: `fixed locally, not released`
- Discovery date: `2026-09-13`
- Affected versions: `@abaplint/transpiler 2.13.86`
- Affected ABAP statement, runtime API or adapter: any built-in function call (`cos`, `sin`, `nmax`, `lines`, `frac`) inside an expression carrying more than one constructor expression
- Minimal ABAP reproducer: in a class, `lv = CONV f( 1 ) + CONV f( 2 ) * nmax( val1 = 0 val2 = lv_ax * cos( lv_ax ) ).`
- Exact command used to run it: `npx abap_transpile`, then calling the method: `TypeError: this.cos is not a function`
- Expected SAP behaviour: `cos` is a built-in unless the class defines a method of that name, in which case the method wins
- Actual open-abap behaviour: emitted as `await this.cos( )`. The decision rests on a BuiltinMethodReference the syntax check records, and in this shape it records none, so the call fell through to the `this.` case. Same root as the two above: one reference per expression
- Impact on open-steamgate: none of ours; it is why several vivid-vibes effects failed at runtime rather than at build time, which is the worse of the two
- Smallest safe workaround: split the expression
- Upstream issue: none yet, PR deferred. Fixed in the same local branch: an unrecorded name is taken as a built-in only when it is the first call in its chain, `abaplint.BuiltIn.searchBuiltin` knows it, and the enclosing class has no method of that name. The chain condition matters, `mi_merge->get_result( )-stage->count( )` is a method called COUNT
- Regression-test location: the transpiler's `test/files.ts`, local branch, both directions
- Upstream version containing a fix: `unknown`

### ANOMALY-2026-09-13-sy-tabix-not-restored — An inner loop keeps the outer loop's `sy-tabix`

- Status: `fixed locally, PR parked`
- Discovery date: `2026-09-13`
- Affected versions: `@abaplint/runtime 2.13.86`
- Affected ABAP statement, runtime API or adapter: `LOOP AT` and `sy-tabix`
- Minimal ABAP reproducer:

```abap
LOOP AT lt_outer INTO DATA(lv_o).
  LOOP AT lt_inner INTO DATA(lv_i).
  ENDLOOP.
  lv_out = lv_out && |{ sy-tabix }|.
ENDLOOP.
```

- Exact command used to run it: `npx mocha build/test/statements/loop.js` in the transpiler checkout; found by open-steamgate driving vivid-vibes' `send_megademo`
- Expected SAP behaviour: `123`. A loop owns `sy-tabix` only while it runs; leaving it, by `ENDLOOP` or `EXIT` or `RETURN` or an exception, restores what the enclosing loop had
- Actual open-abap behaviour: `333`. The inner loop leaves its own last index behind, so the outer body reads the inner loop's row number as its own
- Impact on open-steamgate: her `send_megademo` calls `zcl_o4d_demo=>get( )` in the loop body, which walks its own table, and then writes a separator when `sy-tabix > 1`. The separators land wrong, and the frame is a JSON array that is well formed everywhere except one character. Nothing on our side reports anything; the browser says `Expected ',' or ']' after array element in JSON at position 236`. Same family as the day's other findings: output that is valid-looking, plausible, the right size, and wrong
- Smallest safe workaround: read `sy-tabix` into a variable as the first statement of the loop body, before anything that might loop
- Upstream issue: none yet, branch `fix/sy-tabix-restore` in `abaplint/transpiler`, commit `be5d4db9`. Save on entry, restore in the `finally` that already runs, so every exit path is covered by construction. Full suite 2224/133 before, 2227/130 after, and the three that moved are the new tests
- Regression-test location: `test/statements/loop.ts`, three cases: nested, inner loop left with `EXIT`, and a method that loops called from a loop
- Upstream version containing a fix: `unknown`

### DEBT-2026-09-13-runtime-not-linked — The transpiler is linked from our clone, the runtime is not

- Status: `open`
- Discovery date: `2026-09-13`
- Affected versions: `@abaplint/transpiler-cli` linked, `@abaplint/runtime 2.13.86` published
- Affected ABAP statement, runtime API or adapter: none; a build-topology note
- Minimal ABAP reproducer: none
- Exact command used to run it: `ls -la node_modules/@abaplint/`
- Expected SAP behaviour: n/a
- Actual open-abap behaviour: only `transpiler-cli` is a symlink into `~/dev/transpiler`; `@abaplint/runtime` in each consuming tree is the published copy. So a fix in `packages/transpiler` or `packages/cli` reaches a rebuild immediately and a fix in `packages/runtime` does not, and the two feel identical from the outside. The `sy-tabix` fix above is a runtime fix and is therefore *not* in any running demo
- Impact on open-steamgate: a fix can be reported as done and still be absent from the process that needed it. Whoever wants a runtime fix locally has to link `@abaplint/runtime` too, deliberately, and say so here
- Smallest safe workaround: `npm link @abaplint/runtime` in the consuming tree, or wait for a release
- Upstream issue: none; this is ours. Related: `DEBT-2026-09-13-linked-transpiler`
- Regression-test location: `tools/osd-transpiler.mjs` now prints both, and `npm run transpiler:which` says in two lines which transpiler wrote the code and which runtime will execute it. That is the check; it does not make the two match, it makes the mismatch visible. `npm run runtime:local` links the runtime deliberately, the same way `transpiler:local` does
- Upstream version containing a fix: `n/a`

### ANOMALY-2026-09-13-xstring-as-hex — An xstring costs two characters per byte, twice over

- Status: `open`
- Discovery date: `2026-09-13`
- Affected versions: `@abaplint/runtime 2.13.86`
- Affected ABAP statement, runtime API or adapter: `xstring` itself, and anything that moves a large one: `WWWDATA_IMPORT`, `SCMS_BINARY_TO_XSTRING`, a media response
- Minimal ABAP reproducer: read a four megabyte W3MI object and send it as a response
- Exact command used to run it: open-steamgate serving her 4 MB MP3 through the SMW0 chain, measured over twenty-four requests
- Expected SAP behaviour: an xstring is bytes and costs bytes
- Actual open-abap behaviour: the runtime carries an xstring as a hex string, two characters to the byte, and the SMW0 path holds it twice at once, once sliced into a table and once joined back. Serving 4 MB costs about 24 MB of transient strings per request; the heap goes 744 MB to 901 MB over twenty-four requests and then flattens, so it is a plateau rather than a leak
- Impact on open-steamgate: nothing breaks. It is the reason a media-heavy page is expensive rather than cheap, and it will be the reason the browser bundle is heavy when the media go into it
- Smallest safe workaround: none worth having. Reading the file from disk instead was considered and rejected, because `WWWDATA_IMPORT` has to return a table the caller loops over and her CCP class does exactly that
- Upstream issue: none. The real fix is an xstring carried as a byte buffer rather than a hex string, which is the open-abap runtime's shape rather than something a caller can route around, and it is a large change. Recorded because the number is worth having before someone diagnoses it as a leak
- Regression-test location: none
- Upstream version containing a fix: `unknown`

### DEBT-2026-09-13-linked-transpiler — This tree may be built by a transpiler that is not published

- Status: `accepted, with a banner`
- Discovery date: `2026-09-13`
- What it is: four transpiler defects found on oisee/vivid-vibes are fixed in a local branch of `abaplint/transpiler` (`fix/conv-builtin-type`) and not released. `npm link @abaplint/transpiler-cli` puts that build in a tree, which is what makes SMW0 content, the vivid-vibes effects and anything else those four fixes touch work at all
- The cost, said plainly: a linked tree differs from a clean clone, so `npm test` can be green here and red in CI, and nothing about the repository says why. That is the same failure the W3MIMETABTYPE hunt cost a morning on, and it is worth having a rule about rather than a memory
- What keeps it honest: every transpile prints which transpiler produced it, published or local, and a local one prints the path, the branch and the commit (`tools/osd-transpiler.mjs`, first line of `npm run transpile`). `npm run transpiler:which` answers on demand. So a green run here and a red one in CI are one line apart from being explained rather than a mystery
- How to switch: `npm run transpiler:local` links the local build, `npm run transpiler:published` puts the released one back. `npm ci` and `npm install` silently drop the link, which the banner then says
- Who is on it: the transpiler session's tree is linked; open-steamgate's is its own choice
- How it ends: four pull requests upstream, one per fix, at which point the link comes out and this entry moves to the resolved section. The four are recorded above with their reproducers
- Upstream issue: none yet, deferred by Alice 2026-09-13

### ANOMALY-2026-09-13-percent-in-filename — A percent in a file name is not escaped in the import specifier

- Status: `fixed locally, not released`
- Discovery date: `2026-09-13`
- Affected versions: `@abaplint/transpiler 2.13.86`
- Affected ABAP statement, runtime API or adapter: not ABAP — any object whose abapGit file name carries a percent, which is every W3MI (Web Repository) object, because abapGit encodes the dot of `ZO4D_06_PLASMA.PNG` as `zo4d_06_plasma%2epng`
- Minimal ABAP reproducer: none needed; a file named `a%2eb.mjs`, imported as `./a%2eb.mjs`, is `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, and as `./a%252eb.mjs` it is found
- Exact command used to run it: `npx abap_transpile` over a repository with any SMW0 image, then `node output/init.mjs`
- Expected SAP behaviour: n/a — a runtime resolution rule, not a SAP one. A module specifier is a URL and is percent-decoded before it resolves, so a percent in a name has to be escaped as `%25`
- Actual open-abap behaviour: `init.mjs` throws `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` at boot with the module sitting beside it, so adding an image to a build takes the whole runtime down: the ADT façade and the OData front never start, not only the images
- Impact on open-steamgate: found by open-steamgate on oisee/vivid-vibes, whose media are W3MI objects. Nothing of ours carries a percent today
- Smallest safe workaround: exclude `\.w3mi\.` from the transpile, which is what the vivid-vibes staging did until this was fixed
- Upstream issue: none yet, PR deferred by Alice 2026-09-13. Fixed in the same local branch of the transpiler as the three above: the percent is escaped before the slash in `escapeNamespaceFilename`, and the order matters because escaping it afterwards would corrupt the `%23` the same function writes for a namespace. Both specifier writers and the CLI's `sourceMappingURL` use it
- Regression-test location: the transpiler's `test/files.ts`, local branch
- Upstream version containing a fix: `unknown`

### ANOMALY-2026-09-13-w3mi-objid-encoded — The W3MI registry is keyed on the encoded file name, not the object name

- Status: `open`
- Discovery date: `2026-09-13`
- Affected versions: `@abaplint/transpiler 2.13.86`
- Affected ABAP statement, runtime API or adapter: `SELECT ... FROM wwwparams WHERE objid = ...` and the W3MI registry the transpiler generates
- Minimal ABAP reproducer: a W3MI object whose name carries a dot; read it back with the name that is in `<NAME>` in its own XML
- Exact command used to run it: reading an image through a handler that follows SAP's own API shape
- Expected SAP behaviour: **the plain name**, the one in `<NAME>`. Answered on 2026-09-13 by open-steamgate from the artefact rather than from a system: her page asks for `?audio=ZOISEE-EAR-02.MP3`, her handler passes that straight to `objid`, and that code runs on a real system. Evidence of that grade rather than a read of `wwwparams` on A4H, which is still worth one line the next time someone is on a system with Alice's say-so
- Actual open-abap behaviour: the registry and the `wwwparams` rows are keyed on the encoded name, `ZOISEE-EAR-02%2EMP3`, while the object's own XML carries `ZOISEE-EAR-02.MP3`, so a handler that asks the way SAP's API is asked finds nothing and returns empty rather than failing. The percent-escape is an abapGit filename spelling that should never have become a key
- Impact on open-steamgate: this is what stops the audio in the running demo. The images work only because they were asked for by the encoded name while testing, which is the failure mode in miniature: the wrong key looks like a working one until someone uses the right one
- Smallest safe workaround: ask with the encoded name
- Upstream issue: none yet. The fix is to key both the registry and `wwwparams` on `<NAME>`; open-steamgate owns that code and the change is theirs to make

### ANOMALY-2026-09-13-default-ignore — `DEFAULT IGNORE` is parsed and not honoured, and the project cannot switch the rule off

- Status: `open`
- Discovery date: `2026-09-13`
- Affected versions: `@abaplint/core 2.120.5`, `@abaplint/transpiler-cli 2.13.86`
- Affected ABAP statement, runtime API or adapter: `METHODS m DEFAULT IGNORE` / `DEFAULT FAIL` in an interface
- Minimal ABAP reproducer: an interface with one `DEFAULT IGNORE` method and a class that implements the interface and not that method
- Exact command used to run it: `npx abaplint`, then `npx abap_transpile`
- Expected SAP behaviour: a class need not implement an optional interface method; calling it does nothing (`IGNORE`) or raises (`FAIL`)
- Actual open-abap behaviour: `implement_methods` demands it anyway, and turning the rule off in `abaplint.jsonc` changes nothing for the transpile, which runs its own mandatory rule set rather than the project's
- Impact on open-steamgate: none of ours; found by open-steamgate on vivid-vibes, where an interface grew two methods and fifty implementors were never updated. It is the reason the repository needs 154 written-out implementations rather than two words in the interface
- Smallest safe workaround: implement the method with an empty body, which is what the patch for that repository does
- Upstream issue: none yet; the transpiler session owns it, batched with the three above

### ANOMALY-2026-09-12-transpiler-concat-chain — An `&`/`&&` chain nests one concat( ) call per operand

- Status: `workaround`
- Discovery date: `2026-09-12`
- Affected versions: `@abaplint/transpiler-cli 2.13.85`
- Affected ABAP statement, runtime API or adapter: `a & b & c ...` (also `&&`), `abap.operators.concat`
- Minimal ABAP reproducer: the `IF_SADL_GW_DPC_UTIL~GET_DPC` segw-gen writes for a project with many entity sets (`gen/stg/zstg_segw/zcl_zstg_segw_dpc.clas.abap`, 55 sets, ~830 operands)
- Exact command used to run it: `npm run e2e:preview` (the service worker refuses the bundle: "ServiceWorker script evaluation failed", CDP says "Maximum call stack size exceeded"; Node and a dedicated worker parse the same file)
- Expected SAP behaviour: a chain of any length is one string expression
- Actual open-abap behaviour: `concat(a, concat(b, concat(c, ...)))`, one nesting level per operand; the runtime already accepts `concat([a, b, c])` (used for constant chains) but the Source transpiler does not emit it
- Impact on open-steamgate: the browser preview (GitHub Pages) fails to install its worker once any transpiled class carries a chain of ~800 operands
- Smallest safe workaround: `tools/segw-gen.mjs` builds a SADL definition longer than `SADL_CHUNK` (200) lines in pieces (`lv_sadl_xml = lv_sadl_xml & ...`); every SAP project we have is shorter (85 max), so their generated classes are unchanged
- Upstream issue: PR "Source: flatten & / && chains into concat([...])" from `oisee/transpiler`
- Regression-test location: `test/e2e/preview.spec.mjs` (the preview installs), `test/stg-compile.mjs`
- Upstream version containing a fix: `unknown`

### ANOMALY-2026-09-13-bun-percent-encoded-specifier — Bun does not decode `%23` in an ESM specifier

- Status: `workaround`
- Discovery date: `2026-09-13`
- Affected versions: `bun 1.4.2`, `@abaplint/transpiler-cli 2.13.86`
- Affected ABAP statement, runtime API or adapter: not ABAP — the transpiled output of any `/NAMESPACE/`-prefixed object, whose file name carries `#` and whose importers write it percent-encoded (`await import("./%23iwbep%23cl_mgw_data_util.clas.mjs")`)
- Minimal ABAP reproducer: none needed; two files, `mod.mjs` renamed to `#h#mod.mjs`, imported once as `"./%23h%23mod.mjs"` and once as `"./#h#mod.mjs"`
- Exact command used to run it: `node enc.mjs` / `bun enc.mjs` (percent-encoded) and `node lit.mjs` / `bun lit.mjs` (literal)
- Expected SAP behaviour: n/a — this is a runtime divergence, not a SAP one. Node resolves the percent-encoded form and refuses the literal; Bun does the exact opposite, so no single specifier satisfies both
- Actual open-abap behaviour: under Bun the run dies at the first such import with `Cannot find module "./%23iwbep%23cl_mgw_data_util.clas.mjs"`. 99 files in `output/` carry a `#` today
- Impact on open-steamgate: nothing today (we run Node); it blocks the whole Bun path, so it blocks `bun build --compile` and any single-binary packaging of the OSD
- Smallest safe workaround: rename `#` out of the file names in a copy of `output/` and apply the same substitution inside relative `./*.mjs` specifiers (`.local/dehash.mjs`, ~20 lines, 99 renames and 22 rewrites). With it Bun runs the same 107 ABAP Unit tests as Node and serves the gateway over HTTP; see `docs/bun-spike.md`
- Upstream issue: https://github.com/abaplint/transpiler/issues/1841 (open 2026-09-13, filed by the transpiler session, this spike cited as the evidence). Traced to `escapeNamespaceFilename` in `packages/transpiler/src/initialization.ts` and the source-map line in `packages/cli/src/index.ts`, both of which write `/` as `%23`. Filed as an issue rather than a patch because changing the character changes every mapping from a file back to an object name, so the choice is Lars's; `$`, `-` and `_` are the candidates that need no encoding anywhere. A Bun issue for the specifier decoding is the other half and is not filed
