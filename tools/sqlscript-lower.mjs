// Lowering the relational IR into one engine's dialect.
//
// The whole point of the splitter is that this is the ONLY place a dialect
// is known (docs/sqlscript-splitter.md). The host half - control flow,
// scalars, loops - is JavaScript and never comes here; what arrives is a
// relational subtree, and what leaves is one statement plus its bound
// values, ready for the seam's `native()` (docs/db-seam-native.md).
//
// Values are bound, identifiers are generated: a param becomes a placeholder
// and travels in `params`, and a relation already known to the seam becomes
// whatever `relationRef()` gave us. Nothing is interpolated.
//
// The divergences below are measured, not assumed:
//
//   1 / 2         HANA 0.500000, DuckDB 0.5, sql.js 0
//   -7 / 2        HANA -3.500000, DuckDB -3.5, sql.js -3
//   CAST('x' AS INTEGER)  HANA raises, DuckDB raises, sql.js returns 0
//
// Three more, measured 2026-09-19 against HANA Express when CAST and LIKE
// were added, and every one of them a silent wrong answer rather than an
// error:
//
//   'ABC' LIKE 'abc'          HANA no, DuckDB no, sql.js MATCH
//   CAST('abcdef' AS NVARCHAR(3))   HANA 'abc', DuckDB 'abcdef', sql.js 'abcdef'
//   CAST(1.7 AS INTEGER)      HANA 1, DuckDB 2, sql.js 1
//
// The last one is the uncomfortable one: DuckDB was the engine this file
// trusted to pass casts through, and it ROUNDS where HANA truncates. It had
// been passing casts through since the day the dialect was written. The
// renderings below were then measured back against HANA before being
// written, not reasoned about -- `SUBSTR(CAST(x AS VARCHAR), 1, n)` and
// `CAST(TRUNC(CAST(x AS DOUBLE)) AS INTEGER)` agree with HANA on all six
// probes, including raising on a value that will not convert.
//
// The first line was written the other way round here until the oracle
// answered: this file assumed HANA truncated integer division, and it does
// not - `/` over two INTEGERs yields a decimal. So DuckDB was the engine
// that already matched and the browser engine is the outlier, which is the
// opposite of what the code did. Fixed below, and left on the record,
// because the assumption was plausible, uncontested and wrong.
//
// So division and casts have a per-dialect rendering rather than a
// pass-through, and a dialect that cannot express one refuses instead of
// approximating. Refusing is a feature: an engine that quietly returns a
// different number is the failure this project has already paid for twice.
