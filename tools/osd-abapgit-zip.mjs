//
// Why this exists (Alice, 2026-09-19). The last mile of this project is
// "SEGW project offline -> abapGit -> a system", and it is the one arc of the
// README's loop that had never been walked. It stopped on a system with no
// abapGit installed: the three SEGW objects -- IWPR, IWSV, IWMO -- are not
// ADT object types, so nothing else can put them there, and abapGit's own
// standalone report would not activate on that release. So the machine route
// is blocked and the human one is not: a zip, imported by hand.
//
// The shape is the one `zcl_stg_segw_repo` writes, and deliberately so: the
// same repository whether it is built here in JavaScript or there in ABAP.
// `.abapgit.xml` with STARTING_FOLDER /src/ and FOLDER_LOGIC PREFIX, a
// `src/package.devc.xml`, and every object beside it.

// runtime does not serve another client's rows. On A4H all four arrived as
// MANDT 001, so the fixture did not leak -- it was *moved*, and a demo on a
// real system answered a row labelled "must not leak" (2026-09-19).
//
// It is a fixture for a property of this runtime and it has no meaning on a
// system that decides the client itself, so it stays here. The rule is the
