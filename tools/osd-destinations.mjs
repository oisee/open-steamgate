// One registry for "which other system is that", and one for "who answers
// this path with it".
//
// **Why this exists, and it is a mess of mine from yesterday.** Within a day
// this tree grew two files for one idea:
//
//   .local/rfc-destinations.json       name -> {kind: local|live|replay|…}
//   .local/gateway-destinations.json   SERVICE NAME -> {url, user, password}
//
// fable-osd found the seam by needing a third use: a preflight is keyed by
// **system**, not by service, and bending the second file into that shape
// would have made a third. The right split is the one SM59 already has, and
// it is not "one file with a kind" -- that was my first answer and it is
// wrong, because RFC's `kind` already means *how to satisfy this call*
// (local, replay, live, record, fallback) and would have collided with a
// transport discriminator.
//
// So two things, named apart:
//
//   a **destination** is a system            A4H = {type: http|rfc, …}
//   a **binding** says who uses it here      ZOSD_006_DEMO_SRV -> A4H
//
// A preflight names a destination. A proxy names a binding. An RFC call
// names a destination. Nothing has to be re-keyed to be reused, which was
// the whole complaint.
//
// **Nothing on disk has to change to keep working.** Without the unified
// file this reads the two legacy ones and says so, once, because a tool that
// silently reads something other than what it documents is how the next
// session loses an evening.
