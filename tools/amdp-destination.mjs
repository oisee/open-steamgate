 *  "2026-09-18", "14:30:05", "2026-09-18T14:30:05.123". ABAP holds a date as
 *  CHAR(8) "20260918" and a time as CHAR(6) "143005", so the separators come
 *  out. Without this `set()` would store "2026-09-" into a CHAR(8) date and
 *  be quietly wrong, which is the failure mode this whole file keeps meeting.
 *
 *  Our own tables never hit this path: the transpiler writes ABAP D and T as
 *  NCHAR(8) and NCHAR(6), so they come back as "20260918" already. It matters
 *  when an AMDP body returns a real HANA date, `SELECT CURRENT_DATE` being
