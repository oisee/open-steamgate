//                         flag the body of every method whose findings do

//                         all stub. Blocks are cut at abaplint's parsed

//                         5). A DDIC-kind name a would-be-stubbed method
//                         names is asked from the dumper in the SAME
//                         iteration; only code kinds stay `deferred`
//                         (--defer-ddic keeps round 3). The nameless
//                         stubs' findings are the framework work list:
//                         framework-gaps.json beside the stubs, "framework
//                         gaps: N" on the line. Before anything is
//                         requested the island is checked by file name
//                         (abapGit naming; the XML present for the DDIC
//                         kinds; a code kind as .clas.abap OR .intf.abap):
//                         a name whose object the island holds is never
//                         requested, never a gap -- its finding is a
//                         cascade of that object's own, "cascade (present)"
//                         on the line. When no stub applies any more, the
//                         EXCLUSION decision runs over the whole island as
//                         a GRAPH analysis (tools/hana-closure-graph.mjs

//                         naming an excluded object is stripped, never
//                         excluding; and NEVER a registered service's own
//                         class -- the MPC/DPC/_EXT pairs a registration
//                         names, or by suffix without one: the run fails
//                         instead. Since H5x-3 (fix round 1) the island's
//                         TEST CODE -- a class whose OWN definition is the

//                         inheriting from or implementing the framework's
//                         classes/interfaces; never a class that merely
//                         references one) -- leaves the build before any of
//                         this is needed: recorded {testCode: true} in the
//                         record's roots, never stubbed, never asked, never
//                         a framework gap; a dependent of a test-code root
//                         falls as a CASCADE of it through the graph
//                         decision's seeds, and a FRIENDS clause naming one
//                         strips. Since
//                         H5x-2 the names come from the
//                         structural pass (references(), one SyntaxLogic
//                         pass per object): a signature-level miss (a
//                         parameter typed by a missing name) stays whole
//                         while its DDIC name is pending and is otherwise
//                         cut from the METHODS statement with the body
//                         stubbed, and a GLOBAL FRIENDS clause naming a
//                         gone object (excluded, or answered missing/
//                         refused) is stripped -- a friend that leaves
//                         costs the clause, never the class.
//   --defer-ddic          keeps round 3's behaviour: every name of a
//                         stubbed method is lazy, even the dictionary's.
//   --max-stub-rounds <n> the cap of the stub rounds above (default 5, and
//                         only read with --stub-unresolved).
//   --require-unstubbed <glob>
//                         repeatable: the fixed point FAILS when a seed
//                         class's method matching the glob (`*_GET_ENTITYSET`;
//                         `CLASS=>METHOD` with `=>`) is stubbed. Every fixed
//                         point writes closure-summary.json beside the record
//                         (tools/hana-closure-report.mjs) and fails as well
//                         when a seed class -- the registered service's
//                         MPC/DPC/_EXT -- is not an island object or is
//                         excluded: a green build without the service is the
//                         false green this guards against (H5x-4 B1).
//
// The layers accumulate (round 4): every dump is converted first, into
// .local/hana-closure/layers-<NNN>/ (OSD_HANA_CONVERTER through
// scriptCommandIn, one run per dump, remembered in state.json), and
// hana-src-gen is called with ALL of them -- the island is the UNION of
// the seed dump and every dump so far, later wins per object; the DDIC
// accumulates by hana-ddic-gen's own write mode (per-file overlays). The
// island's object count (classes+interfaces+tables) rides the iteration
// line and never shrinks, per kind (classes, interfaces, tables) -- a
// shrink aborts with both counts (bed run 5; per kind since round 5).
// No fixed point without a positive control (bed run 4): the build runs
// first -- exit 0 or non-zero-with-findings stands, non-zero with NO
// findings aborts with the build's FAILED line.
//
// The writer of record is per NAME (round 7): every DDIC name the dumps
// RESOLVED (manifest.closure.resolved per kind, accumulated in state.json)
// must have an XML in the island; the names without one -- the converter's
// TADIR package selection skipped them -- are written by hana-ddic-gen
// --from-dump --names for exactly those names, into gen/hana-ddic, where
// the converter's file wins where it wrote one (the later layer folder
// wins). The iteration line carries the per-kind gap counts and the
// resolved-vs-written DDIC counts, so a writer-of-record hole is visible.
//
// One iteration: merge the current dump into the inputs (hana-src-gen
// --layers writes gen/hana-src from ALL the layers dirs; gen/hana-ddic is
// written by hana-ddic-gen --from-dump ONLY when the layers carry no DDIC
// XML -- with the converter as the DDIC's writer of record the step is
// skipped, one log line says so -- spawned through tools/osd-host.mjs's
// toolCommandIn and scriptCommandIn, the way every tool a tool starts is;
// the DDIC tool's --from-dump is PR #926 (merged), and a tool that does
// not know the flag is refused with a message saying so),
// then run the
// build's own validation over the tree -- the same channel hana-ddic-gen
// --from-build reads, the validationMessage exported from there, reused and
// not duplicated -- and classify the findings OF THE ISLAND: the service
// lives in gen/hana-src/* and gen/hana-ddic/*, and the validation reports
// bare file names, so the island is a basename set collected from those
// folders. A finding outside it -- src/, packs/, another gen/ folder -- is
// the tree's own business: counted once per iteration line, never asked.
// A merge tool's refusal of one object (the H5a TABCLASS guard:
// `hana-ddic-map: <name>: TABCLASS APPEND is not written here`, the tool
// exits 2) does not stop the loop either: the refusal is parsed, the object
// is recorded as a gap (kind TABL, reason "unsupported TABCLASS APPEND" --
// the dictionary HAS it, the generator here cannot write it, asking cannot
// source it), and the step retries against a filtered copy of the dump in
// .local/hana-closure/ (DD02L.jsonl minus the refused rows). Every other
// finding the transpiler emits, of the island, is classified:
//
//   DDIC            `Database table or view "x" not found` (TABL);
//                   `contains unknown: X not found` (data element or the
//                   DDIC kind the dumper resolves, DTEL when the fix says
//                   lookupDataElement); `Contains unknown, X not found`
//                   (the error's first line); `contains unknown: X,
//                   lookupDomain` (DOMA); `field not part of structure
//                   x-comp` (a TABL structure)
//   program object  `Class x not found`, `Unknown class x` (CLAS, INTF for
//                   an if_* name), `CATCH, unknown class CX_*` (CLAS),
//                   `Super class "X" not found or contains errors` (CLAS,
//                   round 7), `Target type unknown, X` (round 7: the
//                   kind-less dictionary triple),
//                   `could not resolve top X` / `unable to resolve x`
//                   (INTF for an IF_* name), and a `parser_error` naming
//                   "FUNCTION" in a `*.fugr.*` file (the function group
//                   itself, its name read off the file)
//   cascade         `Method (or attribute) "m" not found`, `Component "c"
//                   not found in structure`, `Not an object reference`,
//                   `not a table type mt_*`, `... not found in class or
//                   interface`, `"param" not found` with fix findTop/Target
//                   -- the search-help exits' TABLES signatures, whose
//                   types arrive with the function group -- and since round
//                   7 (bed run 10): `Definition for "X" not found in
//                   scope(AttributeName)`, `Method parameter type not
//                   compatible`, `N cannot be instantiated, class is
//                   defined as protected`. Skipped: the name is not the
//                   thing that is missing.
//
// Names are upper-cased, de-duplicated, and split into fresh (never asked)
// and gaps (asked in an earlier round, still unresolved -- not in the
// tenant, or a kind this route cannot source yet). The gaps file carries
// each gap's TADIR kind, the first finding that named it and the number of
// validation passes that have named it; a dump manifest's `closure.missing`
// joins them with the kind they are missing under, read on every
// continuation -- the answer is per kind, and a name that resolved under
// one of the kinds it was asked under is one the dictionary HAS: the other
// kinds' `missing` is not "does not exist" and never makes it a gap. No
// fresh names is the fixed point. Otherwise the request goes to
// closure-request.json -- schema 1, the file the dumper's reader reads:
// requested/seen under the nine upper-case TADIR kinds, seen = every name
// an earlier iteration asked (so the dumper skips it), gaps = the current
// gaps, generation = the hash the merge's manifest carries of the dump's
// own manifest -- and the dumper runs:
//
//   $OSD_HANA_DUMPER hana dump --host <HANA_HOST> --port <HANA_PORT> \
//       --user <HANA_USER> --schema <HANA_SCHEMA> \
//       --provenance "hana-closure iteration <n>: the closure request's names" \
//       --ddic-closure <out>/closure-request.json \
//       --out <root>/.local/hana-closure/dump-<NNN> \
//       --skip-test-includes --allow-in-repo
//
// The loop's own log line for that command is redacted -- `--host <env>`
// and the like, never the values: a loop log is exactly what gets pasted
// into a report, and the values travel only in the by-hand command printed
// when no dumper is configured (and in the child's environment).
// --skip-test-includes is the dumper's own flag (round 7, off by default
// there) and rides on every call: the closure must never carry CCAU test
// includes (bed run 12 pulled SAP's unit-test assertion class through a
// facade's test include and stubbed six of its methods). The island rule
// for the files a dump carries anyway is hana-src-gen's (round 7).
//
// A name the transpiler names without a dictionary kind (the `ddic` bucket:
// the message says only that the type is unknown) is requested under TABL,
// DTEL and TTYP -- SHLP too when the finding itself says search help; the
// dumper answers what exists and reports the rest in `closure.missing`.
//
// OSD_HANA_DUMPER names the binary and OSD_HANA_DUMP_ENV an env file with
// the connection (KEY=VALUE lines, `#` comments, `export ` allowed):
// HANA_HOST/HANA_PORT/HANA_USER/HANA_SCHEMA become the argv flags the real
// dumper marks required, and HANA_PASSWORD becomes VSP_HANA_PASSWORD in the
// child's environment -- the one thing the dumper reads from the
// environment, and the one secret: nothing from the env file but the
// connection flags is on the argv. The dump lands under .local/
// (gitignored, inside the working tree, which the dumper refuses -- hence
// --allow-in-repo). The dumper is a foreign binary -- another project's,
// with credentials of its own -- so it is spawned by the path the
// environment names, never through toolCommand/scriptCommandIn (which would
// dispatch it through `osd gen` or put a node interpreter in front of it)
// and never process.execPath.
//
// The request is written BEFORE any dumper round, and writing it marks its
// names asked (state.json) and the round pending: with the dumper
// configured the next run executes the pending round first; a hand-run dump
// is continued with --dump <dir>, and names still unresolved there surface
// as gaps. --dry-run writes and prints the request and stops;
// --max-iterations bounds the rounds of a run and stops with the pending
// request on disk.
//
// **No HANA from here**: everything above the dumper is tested against a
// scratch tree and a fake dumper that mimics the real CLI contract (the
// required flags, the schema-1 request, the git-tree refusal unless
// --allow-in-repo, the password from VSP_HANA_PASSWORD only) --
// test/hana-closure.mjs, fixtures ZOSD_H5C_*; the real iteration is dell's,
// on the bed.
