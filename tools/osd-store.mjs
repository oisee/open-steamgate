// it is part of. The check returns the same shape for a write and for an
// activation, since the façade reports both the same way.

 *  a file it cannot compile; folder-shaped ones removed the program in

 *  the transpiler read this file", the store's is "is this an object of the
 *  system", and no amount of looking at the pattern turns one into the
