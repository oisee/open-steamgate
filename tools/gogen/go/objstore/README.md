# objstore -- ZOSD_STORE over abapGit-named files

What: the object store of the Go host, `CALL FUNCTION 'ZOSD_STORE' DESTINATION 'STORE'` answered over the
files the Node host answers it over (tools/osd-store.mjs, tools/osd-store-destination.mjs); filesystem reads
(LIST, READ, OBJECT, PACKAGE, PACKAGES, SEARCH), history from git, and writes. An injected `Compiler`
supplies CHECK and PARSE kind OUTLINE snapshots; ACTIVATE and TOKENS are still refused. go/abap keeps
`SetStore`, `StoreCall`, the `Store*` type aliases and the
session-first `ZOSD_STORE` adapter (Data in, tables filled).

The compiler boundary uses neutral contracts in `storecheck`; objstore keeps API
aliases, resolution and answer assignment. It captures provider, generation,
file hashes and a store revision under the mutex, then runs CHECK, CHECKRUN and
OUTLINE outside it. A concurrent WRITE, SetStore or SetCompiler rejects the
answer as STALE_RESULT; saved target bytes are rechecked after the call too.
`storecompiler.Adapter` supplies snapshots to the lifecycle-owning client.
CHECKRUN uses Node's shared report builder, including AMDP portability warnings,
and ignores optional includes for saved-source syntax checks. Standalone CHECK
and PARSE refusals remain unchanged. IV_SOURCE still requires a saved draft on
the Go snapshot path; `tools/gogen/storecmp.mjs` ratchets that contract-v1 gap.

SYSTEM is tree-independent. `CallWithSystem(in, provider)` uses the explicitly
passed request's `SystemProvider`, whose `System(kind, name, input)` method
returns the value Node's withSystem callback would return, or an error. Nil
preserves `Call` byte for byte: only the installed IDENTITY answers; other
known kinds keep their existing refusals. The callback runs outside the store
mutex, so it can call back into ABAP or yield without holding the store.
The provider is never cached on the store or installed as a current request.

API: `SetStore(root string, cfg []byte, reason string) error`;
`SetSystemIdentity(Identity)`; `Call(in map[string]*string) Answer`;
`CallWithSystem(in map[string]*string, SystemProvider) Answer`;
`Config`/`Root`, `Answer` with `Row`, `Issue`, `Tally`, `Revision`;
`Identity`; `Capabilities`.

Invariants: the files are the truth and git the history, no second copy; the index is rebuilt per call; a
WRITE touches only a file inside a writable root; answers and their order match the Node destination field
for field (localeCompare order, JSON property order, and the scalar/table envelopes). The frozen proof is
`test/fixtures/osgo-store/destination-golden.json`: `tools/osgo-store-goldens.mjs` records the Node
destination, `tools/gogen/go/objstore/golden_test.go` compares Go, and `test/osgo-store-goldens.mjs` fails on
drift. A refusal is `EV_ERROR`, never a panic. No import of go/abap, no Session.
