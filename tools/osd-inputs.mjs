// The layers of the system: what the transpiler is given, in what order,
// and who wins when two folders hold the same object.
//
// The order is the input_folder list of abap_transpile.json and nothing
// else, and the LATER folder wins, the way a layer does. That is what the
// transpiler does on its own when it is handed the same class twice
// (measured 2026-09-16 over a two-folder tree: the module written last is
// the later folder's; abaplint's registry in memory files the first as the
// main file and calls the second "already defined", so nothing about a
// duplicate is safe to leave to it), what Alice's formulation of backlog
// 1.5 says, and what the object store now does (tools/osd-store.mjs
// rootsOf reads the same list; ours-over-a-library's still holds, because a
// library is not a layer and never wins over an input). The builder hands
// the transpiler the winner only: every file of a hidden object goes into
// the build's exclude_filter (tools/osd-build.mjs), so what runs is decided
// here and not by which file the transpiler happened to write last. The
// same file name twice inside ONE folder, where no order can decide,
// refuses the build with both files named.
//
// Two more ways to edit ABAP and change nothing, both of which cost a day:
// a folder that looks like an input and is not (local/vivid-vibes beside
// local/o4d, only the latter listed: 237 files, an edit there transpiles
// nothing and reports nothing), and an object hidden by a later layer.
// Neither is an error; both are said out loud, here and in the builder's
// log.

 *
 * It lives here rather than in the transpile wrapper because **two lists
 * obliged to agree had diverged**. `tools/osd-store.mjs` carried a
 * hand-written `DEFAULT_LIBS` of three folders while `abap_transpile.json`
 * configured six, so the abaplint registry the store builds could not see
 * `open-abap-apc`, `abapgit` or `open-abap-gui`. Everything compiled and ran;
 * only the *check* was wrong, and it was wrong in the direction that costs
 * most -- it told a person their class was broken. Alice found it on the
 * deployed editor, on two classes at once: `Super class
 * "cl_apc_wsp_ext_stateful_base" not found or contains errors`, where the
 * superclass is in a library the build reads and the store did not
 * (2026-09-19).
 *
 * A lib with no folder on disk is skipped rather than cloned: the transpile
 * may clone a URL-only library, a store asked for one object may not.
