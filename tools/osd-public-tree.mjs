// The provenance of a public artefact, tied to the bytes it ships.
//
// Every publishing edge copies the WORKING TREE (packs, fetched sources,
// build/live, gen/, output/), while the live generation's manifest says what
// the tree was when it was built. A private pack fetched after a public build
// is in the tree and not in the manifest. So an artefact is stamped, and
// verified, only when
//   - the live record is complete and public (assertPublicSystem),
//   - every CURRENT input is recorded public (generationSystem over
//     inputsOf(root), refetched identities and OSD_PACKS folders included),
//   - and the tree hashes to the live generation: hashOf(root) === live,
//     which names private and unknown inputs, so nothing changed since.
// Kept out of osd-system.mjs and osd-provenance.mjs on purpose: the OCI
// publisher's import closure must not reach osd-build, and the Dockerfile
// verifies with osd-provenance.mjs alone.
