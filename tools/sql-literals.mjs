// Trailing blanks on the way into the database, in one place.
//
// ABAP pads a CHAR to its field length, so the runtime hands over
// `'abc       '` for a CHAR(10) holding `abc`. What a database does with
// that is not a detail: a real system does not keep the blanks -- measured
// on A4H, a CHAR(30) holding '$TMP' answers LENGTH 4 -- and HANA's NCHAR
// does not either.
//
// This function existed **twice**, character for character, in
// tools/duckdb-client.mjs and tools/hana-client.mjs, and not at all in the
// two SQLite clients. So the same ABAP INSERT stored three characters on
// DuckDB and ten on the engine the deployed showcase runs (measured
// 2026-09-19), and the system's own behaviour depended on `STG_DB`.
//
// SQLite got away with it because its columns are declared `COLLATE RTRIM`,
// which makes comparisons ignore the padding. Comparisons were never the
// problem: `LENGTH`, `SUBSTR` and `||` see the blanks, and that is seven of
// the fifteen differences the conformance table measures against HANA.
//
// Two copies of a rule is one rule and one stale opinion -- which is the
// same sentence this tree wrote about a refusal predicate the same day.

 * stay untouched because the SQLScript lowering sends its own statements and
 * binds its own values.
 *
 * Applied where every host passes: `test/setup.mjs` is the transpiler's
 * `options.setup`, so the server, the unit run and the preview all go
 * through it. A rule about what every host must do belongs in one module
 * they all reach, not in a comment in the first of them.
