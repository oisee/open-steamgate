// $TMP, the local package of every ABAP system, as a package of this one.
//
// What a real system has, measured on the A4H sandbox (2026-10-02,
// test/fixtures/tmp-package/a4h.json):
//
// - One TDEVC row named $TMP, not one per user: DLVUNIT (software component)
//   LOCAL, PARENTCL empty, PDEVCLASS (transport layer) empty, KORRFLAG
//   empty, delivered by SAP. Its text is "Temporary Objects (never
//   transported!)".
// - An object created in it carries its author (TADIR-AUTHOR, the logged-on
//   user), and needs no transport.
// - The tree of $TMP (repository/nodestructure, no user filter sent) is the
//   logged-on user's: their objects in $TMP and their local packages that
//   hang under $TMP or under nothing. Another user's objects and packages in
//   $TMP are not in it.
// - $TMP CAN be a parent. Sub-packages of $TMP exist on the system and a new
//   one created through ADT with superPackage $TMP was accepted (deleted
//   again). A spike note said otherwise; the system does not agree.
//
// Here a package is a folder (tools/osd-store.mjs), so $TMP is the folder
// TMP_FOLDER, under local/ because local/ is what git ignores: an object of
// $TMP is never transported, and the closest thing to a transport here is a
// commit. It is a layer of the build when it exists (tools/osd-packs.mjs), so
// what is created in it activates and runs like anything else. It never
// leaves for a system: tools/osd-deploy-manifest.mjs and
// tools/osd-abapgit-zip.mjs refuse it, closed rather than open.
//
// Who created an object is not something an abapGit file says, so it is kept
// beside the objects in TMP_AUTHORS, the TADIR of this one package.
