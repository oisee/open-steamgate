// Where in the ABAP did this happen.
//
// A stack from transpiled code names .mjs files and generated line numbers,
// which is the wrong screen for everyone who wrote the ABAP. The transpiler
// can say where each generated line came from — `write_source_map` in
// abap_transpile.json, off by default — and with that on, a position resolves
// to the statement rather than to the object:
//
//   zcl_o4d_sales_dance.clas.mjs:1346   abap.statements.append({source: lv_val, ...})
//   zcl_o4d_sales_dance.clas.abap:119   APPEND lv_val TO rt_values.
//
// This is the only copy of that. osd-unit.mjs used to carry its own, and two
// copies of a thing whose job is to be accurate is how they stop agreeing.
//
// It is deliberately not in the runtime: `node:module` does not exist in a
// browser, and an exception that costs a source-map lookup every time it is
// raised is a worse trade than a log line that asks for one when it needs it.
