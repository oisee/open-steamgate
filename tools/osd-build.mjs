// A generation: the transpiled system, built to the side, named by what
// went into it, made live by renaming a link.
//
// Why this exists: `npm run transpile` used to do `rm -rf output` and then
// build into the hole. A build that failed left the hole. The process that
// was serving survived, because its modules were already loaded, and the
// next recycle or restart did not, because there was nothing left to load.
// So a bad save could quietly turn a working system into one that would not
// come back up, and nobody found out until it did not.
//
// Here a build never touches anything that is live. It goes into a
// directory of its own under build/tmp, and only a complete one is renamed
// into build/by-input/<hash>, where <hash> is the sha256 of every input:
// the files in the input folders, the library trees, the config, and which
// transpiler did the work. The same inputs give the same name, so a rebuild
// with nothing changed costs nothing, and a transpiler upgrade is a new
// generation, as it should be. `build/live` is a symlink to the generation
// that serves, and `output/` at the root is a symlink to `build/live/output`,
// so the runtime child, which reads OSD_ROOT/output and nothing else, is
// switched by one rename and knows nothing about any of this.
//
// Measured before deciding: hashing every input by content is 105 ms for
// this tree and 170 ms for the largest library, so the hash is computed on
// every build and nobody has to reason about mtimes or commits. A
// generation is 44 MB; keeping the last few is cheap. docs/generations.md
// is the design this implements.

 * bundle).
 *
 * So each host names what it will run: node the contents of the closure, the
 * binary itself. **And that means the two hosts legitimately name different
 * generations**, unless the binary was compiled from the very generators the
 * tree holds. That is a true statement about the system rather than a defect
 * to paper over, and the test that asserted equality now asserts what is
 * actually required -- that the two produce the same objects.
