// The second sieve: what SQL a system actually ran (backlog W.1, O.1).
//
// The first sieve compares what two systems ANSWER. This one compares what
// they DID to get there, and it exists because the database seam is the one
// place where being wrong is invisible from outside: a missing MANDT, an
// ORDER BY that differs, an N+1 where the system issues one statement, a
// different FOR ALL ENTRIES chunking -- every one of those can come out with
// the right answer by accident, and none of them shows in a response body.
//
// It is nearly free on our side and that is the argument for doing it first.
// All transpiled ABAP talks to exactly ONE object,
// `abap.context.databaseConnections["DEFAULT"]`, with eleven methods
// (docs/db-backends.md). So there is one interception point, no new protocol,
// and nothing in the ABAP to change.
//
// The shape is deliberately the same as the first sieve's
// (tools/osd-compare.mjs): named rules, each with a reason it is allowed to
// mask a difference, only the structural ones on by default, and what fired
// reported rather than applied quietly. "Identical" and "identical after
// masking three generated names" are different claims.
