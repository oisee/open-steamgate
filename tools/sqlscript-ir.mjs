// The relational half of a SQLScript body, as data.
//
// This is the IR the splitter lowers (docs/sqlscript-splitter.md). It is
// deliberately written and tested BEFORE any parser exists: twenty fixtures
// built by hand answer "can this model express the semantics" for the cost
// of an afternoon, where finding the same answer after a front end exists
// costs a front end. If the model cannot carry it, nothing downstream can.
//
// Two rules the shape follows, both of them measured rather than preferred:
//
//   1. **An assignment to a table variable is not a barrier.** Measured on
//      HANA Express: a projection that would fail does not fail when a later
//      filter removes the offending row, and the same body does fail under
//      NO_INLINE (docs/sqlscript-hana-observed.md). So a chain of assignments
//      is ONE plan here, not three, and `lower()` must produce one statement.
//
//   2. **Every expression carries the type HANA would give it.** Not for
//      documentation: the lowering cannot choose a form without it. `1/2` is
//      0.5 in DuckDB and 0 in SQLite, so a division node that does not know
//      it is integer division has no correct rendering in either.
//
// Nothing here talks to a database. Lowering is in sqlscript-lower.mjs.
