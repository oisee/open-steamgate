// The warm compile: one abaplint registry kept for as long as the process
// lives, so a save costs the objects it reaches and not the tree.
//
// A cold build (tools/osd-build.mjs) runs the generators and transpiles every
// object: ~11 s on this tree. Most saves are an edit to one method of one
// class, which changes that class and whatever reads it, and nothing a
// generator reads. For those, this keeps the registry of the live generation,
// replaces the changed file, and has the transpiler build only the objects the
// change reaches -- the edited ones and, transitively, their readers, taken
// from abaplint's scope references. The transpiler needs three changes for
// that, all proposed upstream (abaplint/transpiler#1898): the temporary names
// numbered per object (#1899), `only` (#1900), and a second run over the
// same registry that checks the chosen objects rather than everything
// (#1921). Without them `probe()` says so and every build stays cold.
//
// The generation it makes is an ordinary one: the live generation's files,
// hard-linked, with the rebuilt modules and the scripts written over them,
// named by the same hash of the inputs a cold build would give it and
// switched to the same way. Whether its bytes are a cold transpile's is not
// assumed: verify() transpiles the same inputs cold in a child process and
// compares, and until that has passed the generation is "warm-unverified".
// verify() runs no generators, so it checks this build against today's
// gen/, not the rule below against the generators.
//
// What is warm is decided file by file, and anything else is cold -- the
// generators read the tree too, and a change they would see has to reach
// them (see warmRule below).

// The generators of a cold build (osd-build.mjs GENERATORS) read the tree,
// and a change one of them would see must go through them. What they read of
// an ABAP source, found by reading each of them (2026-09-25):
//   - amdp-gen: every class with an AMDP body, and every interface as a type
//     source for those bodies;
//   - osd-tran-registry: whether a class names the transaction contract in
//     an INTERFACES line, and a report's source;
//   - osd-gui-convert (2026-09-26): a report's source (*.prog.abap), which
//     the rule below already sends cold -- only a class or an interface is
//     ever warm;
//   - cds2ddic, stg-compile, segw-*, osd-bsp-registry, osd-fm-registry:
//     other object types (DDLS, TABL, IWSV, WAPA, FUGR, YAML), and which
//     class files exist.
// So an edit is warm when it changes the content of a class or interface
// that already exists, outside gen/, with no AMDP body before or after, the
// same INTERFACES lines, and -- for an interface -- no AMDP class naming it.
// A new or removed file, any other object type, a library, the config, a
// page or a generator is cold. test/warm.mjs pins the generator list this
// was read against, so a new generator makes somebody read this again.
