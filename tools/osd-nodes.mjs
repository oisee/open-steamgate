// **The type of a node is where it is declared, not a field somebody set.**
// That is the conclusion of the whole ICF track and it took three of Alice's
// corrections to reach (`docs/icf-registry-plan.md`):
//
//   1. ICF is the only *registry*, not the only *router*.
//   2. Imitate the interface, not the storage.
//   3. What the host serves can stay served by the host -- it only has to be
//      *declared*.
//
// A `*.sicf.xml` is a SAP object: it exists on a system, it transports, and
// the class it names runs anywhere the ABAP runs. A path answered by a
// JavaScript function is none of those, and writing a SICF object for it
// would be a lie in somebody else's format -- an object claiming to travel
// to a system where it does not exist. So those are declared in
// `<layer>/icf/nodes.json` instead, and "does it travel" follows from the
// file rather than from a flag that has to be kept true.
//
// The types, each saying **where the node works** rather than whether it is
// allowed:
//
//   ABAP     a class implementing if_http_extension. Server, binary, preview.
//   HOST     a function of the JavaScript host. Server and binary; not the
//            preview.
//   PROXY    a destination: another system answers. Server and binary only.
//   CONTENT  bytes out of the object store. Everywhere. (Not yet used: the
//            BSP pages are ABAP today and become CONTENT in step A.)

/** Paths a real system already answers on, and what answers there.
 *
 *  **An object of ours on one of these must not travel, and the reason is
 *  that nobody knows what an import would do with it.** The first version of
 *  this said "ICFSERVICE is keyed by the node and abapGit writes the row, so
 *  importing would replace SAP's handler". That mechanism is wrong, and an
 *  adversarial review caught it. Read off `zcl_abapgit_object_sicf` in
 *  .local/lars/abapgit: deserialize calls
 *  `cl_icf_tree=>if_icf_tree~insert_node( icf_name = orig_name, icfparguid =
 *  find_parent( url ) )`, and it decides insert-versus-update by looking for
 *  `icf_name = ms_item-obj_name(15)` -- the **file's** name, not the URL.
 *
 *  Which means three things are true and one is not:
 *
 *    - the URLs below are a real system's (the UI5 one measured on A4H on
 *      2026-09-19, where /sap/bc/ui5_ui5/sap/arsrvc_upb_admn/ answers 200);
 *    - our objects claim them, and `src/bsp/zosd_bsp.sicf.xml` claims
 *      `/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/sap/` while calling itself `zosd_bsp` -- a URL and a
 *      name that disagree, which on a system is not the node it looks like;
 *    - none of our `*.sicf.xml` use abapGit's own SICF file-name format
 *      (a name padded to 15 plus 25 hex, which `osd-bsp-app.mjs` knows), so
 *      the existence check looks for a node that is not there;
 *    - and "it would replace SAP's handler" is **not** established. It might
 *      nest, it might collide, it might fail. Measuring that needs a system,
 *      and this tree touches A4H only when Alice asks.
 *
 *  An object whose effect on a system is unknown is exactly one that should
 *  not be in a zip, so the gate stands and the claim under it is now the one
 *  that was checked. `tools/osd-abapgit-zip.mjs` refuses these outright --
 *  until that commit `travels: false` was an annotation two tools read and
 *  no packaging path did.
 *
 *  Adding a child under one of these is not the same thing and is not
 *  flagged: `/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/sap/zosd_008_app/` is exactly how a Fiori
 *  application reaches a system, measured, and `/sap/bc/apc/sap/zstg_apc_demo`
 *  is how a push channel does. Only a node that claims the delivered node
 *  ITSELF is here. */

 *  order, and whether this build has them at all. `tools/osd-routes.mjs`
 *  then checks both directions, so the declaration and the code cannot
 *  drift apart in silence.
 *
 *  Longest path first, for the same reason `services()` sorts that way:
 *  `/app/packs.json` must not be swallowed by `/app`. That ordering used to
 *  be an accident of the order somebody wrote the lines in.
