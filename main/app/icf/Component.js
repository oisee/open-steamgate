  // whose facets are the three things SICF shows on tabs -- the handler
  // chain, the descriptions per language, and (ours, not SAP's) who last
  // wrote the row.
  //
  // No annotation file beside this component, for the same reason the
  // status app has none: every HeaderInfo, LineItem and Facet comes out of
  // ZOSD_ICF_SRV's own $metadata, generated from src/icf/zosd_icf.stg.yaml.
  // The app is the thinnest thing that can render the service.
  //
  // Read-only, and that is the drift rule rather than a missing feature: a
  // write through OData would go round ZCL_OSD_SICF=>SET_ACTIVE, which
  // keeps the object's hash while flipping the origin, and without that
  // bookkeeping the next build silently undoes the edit
  // (docs/registry-drift.md). The writable cut waits until that rule lives
  // in what the dispatcher writes through.
