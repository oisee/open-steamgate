* The seed of the RAP flight pack: SAP's own data generator, run once.
*
* /DMO/CL_FLIGHT_DATA_GENERATOR is an ADT class run (IF_OO_ADT_CLASSRUN)
* that fills the legacy tables and then, through a BAdI, the managed ones.
* This class gives it the console it asks for and calls it, so that a host
* (tools/rap-flight/seed-capture.mjs) can run it in one dialog step and
* write what it made into data/*.tabu.json -- the seed rows every start
* loads, the way the other packs carry theirs. The generator is random
* with fixed seeds where it matters (cl_abap_random_int seed = 1337 for the
* distances), so a second capture is the same rows where the original is.
*
* The two generator classes this calls are the pack's overlay copies
* (packs/rap-flight/src/#dmo#cl_*), changed only where open-abap-core has
* no number range intervals, no CL_ABAP_RANDOM_INT8 and the transpiler
* does not take four 7.40 constructs (README.md of the pack).
