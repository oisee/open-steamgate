* OSD overlay of the booking pool of the managed scenario (upstream
* managed/#dmo#bp_booking_m.clas.locals_imp.abap, Apache-2.0), changed where
* this runtime differs; each change is marked "OSD overlay" (the kinds are
* listed in the travel pool's overlay header and in docs/rap-flight-pack.md).
* The %path of a message is built from the booking's own key, which carries
* its travel's: the link upstream reads by \_Travel gives the same key.
