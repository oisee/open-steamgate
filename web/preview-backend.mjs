// that can see the pool, the listeners and /proc (tools/osd-status.mjs).
// Here there is no pool, no listener and no process: there is one service
// worker, and the honest snapshot is small. So it is written rather than
// faked -- host_kind "browser", one row in the process table with no pid and
// no port, one port row that says there is no port and why -- and the parts
// the worker cannot see are the build's, generated into ./generated/status.mjs
// (the OData services, the packs, the system id). The JSON is the same
// contract ZCL_OSD_STATUS=>REFRESH parses on a server; nothing about the
// shape is special here, only the values.
//
// The generation is the worker's own stamp, the digest the build wrote into
// the bundle, so gen_live and gen_serving are the same by construction: a
// bundle cannot be serving anything but itself.
// The two readers of the five status tables: the status service itself, and
// the Easy Access menu, which builds its tree out of the same rows
// (src/webgui/, docs/webgui.md). Both take the snapshot that answers them.
