CLASS cl_abap_behavior_saver DEFINITION PUBLIC INHERITING FROM cl_abap_behv CREATE PUBLIC
  GLOBAL FRIENDS zcl_osd_rap_runtime.
* The base of a behavior pool's local saver class (lsc_*): the phases of the
* save sequence, each empty until the pool redefines it. Clean-room; the
* method names and their order are the public contract, and the managed
* runtime (ZCL_OSD_RAP_RUNTIME, a friend) is what calls them:
*
*   finalize -> check_before_save -> adjust_numbers -> save -> cleanup
*   (cleanup_finalize instead of the rest when finalize or
*   check_before_save failed)
*
* R7: save_modified (with additional / unmanaged save) has parameters typed
* by the BDEF. It is declared below for abaplint's static check, which voids
* them as it voids every parameter here; the build blanks that declaration
* (the lines between the LINT-ONLY markers, tools/rap/lower-derived.mjs) and
* turns a pool's `METHODS save_modified REDEFINITION.` into a typed
* declaration of its own, which the generated adapter calls by name
* (docs/rap-runtime.md, R7).
*
* On a system these phases have implicit FAILED / REPORTED (LATE)
* parameters. abaplint voids every parameter of this class's methods (its
* RAP saver workaround, core/abap/types/method_parameters.js), and a void
* parameter does not transpile, so in R2 the phases take none: a saver
* signals nothing back yet (docs/rap-runtime.md).
