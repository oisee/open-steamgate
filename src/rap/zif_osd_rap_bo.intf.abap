INTERFACE zif_osd_rap_bo PUBLIC.
* One behavior definition as the managed runtime sees it: its model, and the
* typed half of every call into its behavior pool. Implemented by a class
* generated from the BDEF (tools/rap/bdef-gen.mjs, gen/rap/), because the
* pool's handler methods are typed with the derived types of that BDEF and
* only generated code knows them. Everything generic -- the buffer, field
* control, numbering, the triggers, the save sequence -- is in
* ZCL_OSD_RAP_RUNTIME (docs/rap-runtime.md).

  TYPES ty_flag TYPE c LENGTH 1.

* one CDS element of an entity. NAME is the CDS name upper case, COLUMN the
* persistent table's column it is saved to (BDEF mapping, else the CDS base).
* READONLY: X always, U on update only. MANDATORY: X always, C on create
* only. NUMBERING: X when the key is drawn by managed numbering (a UUID).

* a determination (D), validation (V) or action (A) and when it runs. ON is
* M (on modify) or S (on save); the triggers are the create and update
* operations and the CDS names in FIELDS. METHOD is the pool's method;
* ENTITIES is set when it takes the instances as a table it changes in
* place (the explicit form), and not when it uses EML (the system's form).
* FEATURES: an action declared ( features : instance ) asks the pool's
* FOR INSTANCE FEATURES method before it runs (R4).
* R6: KIND X is a determine action: no method, MEMBERS the determinations
* on save (D) and validations (V) it runs, ALWAYS set for a member declared
* ( always ). INTERNAL: an internal action, executed only by the BO's own
* handlers (IN LOCAL MODE). FACTORY: a factory action, which answers the
* new instances in MAPPED under the %cid of each import row.
* R8: KIND E is a draft action (Edit, Activate, Discard, Resume), the
* framework's: no method; Prepare is a determine action (X).

* NAME the CDS entity, ALIAS the BDEF alias, RESPONSE the component of the
