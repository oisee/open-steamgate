CLASS ltcl_lazy DEFINITION FOR TESTING DURATION SHORT RISK LEVEL HARMLESS FINAL.
* The stub raise the island's unresolvable methods carry: the text must
* name what is missing, and the RAISE statement must travel as cx_no_check
* -- no RAISING clause anywhere, the way the stub is written into a body
* whose signature came from the dump. And the kernel-side hook (round 5):
* the constructor signals the host -- a handler receives the names when one
* is installed, the console says them when none is -- and a CATCH of the
* raise cannot un-send the signal, which is the property $batch's
* CATCH cx_root must not defeat.
