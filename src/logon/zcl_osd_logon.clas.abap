CLASS zcl_osd_logon DEFINITION
  PUBLIC
  FINAL
  CREATE PRIVATE.
* Who sends the request. On a system that is SY-UNAME, the user the logon
* authenticated. This tree has no logon: SY-UNAME is one constant for the
* process (tools/osd-identity.mjs), so every request is the same user and a
* draft would have no owner to tell apart (docs/rap-runtime.md, R9).
*
* The HTTP fronts (ZCL_STG_HTTP_HANDLER, ZCL_OSD_V4_HTTP) call ENTER with the
* request's Authorization header at entry: the user name of a Basic
* credential is the request's user. The password is not checked -- this is
* identification, not authentication, like the rest of this tree's HTTP
* (no authentication yet; do not put it on a public address). Without the
* header the user is SY-UNAME, as before. The RAP draft runtime asks USER
* for the draft's owner (ZOSD_DRAFT_ADM-INPROCESSBYUSER).
*
* A class static outlives the request here, so ENTER sets it on every
* request, with or without a credential.
